         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Vpon this conceit <hi>Tully lib. 1. de Nat. deo.</hi> ſaid, that he durſt not think himſelfe a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier creature then the <hi>Bull</hi> that tranſported <hi>Europa,</hi> for ſhape he meant, and feature of body. As this ſelf-liking preuaileth in euery kinde toward it ſelfe, ſo doth it no leſſe, but rather more ſhew it ſelfe in euery particular, nature being <hi>optima concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrix,
<pb facs="tcp:8075:5"/> et quaſilena ſui,</hi> the greatlieſt in loue with her ſelfe that may be. And therefore we find daylie that moſt true, <hi>ſuum cuique pulchrum,</hi> and that of <hi>Tul. Te tua, me delectant mea,</hi> who farther alſo <hi>lib. 5. Tuſcul.</hi> ſaith that he neuer knew any poet, were he neuer ſo bad, but he thought himſelfe the beſt that euer was. Such is the folly of riming wits. Euen <hi>Chaerilus</hi> ſo much diſgraced by <hi>Horace,</hi> yet as may appeare by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with <hi>Alexander,</hi> thought himſelfe no babe. Of whom <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der</hi> was wont to ſay, that he had rather be <hi>Homers Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,</hi> then the <hi>Achilles</hi> of <hi>Chaerilus.</hi> Although I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that <hi>Euſebius, Clemens,</hi> &amp; ſome other of the Ancients, make good reckening of him: neither ſeemeth he to haue bin ſo bad as he is made by certaine verſes of his which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. But (to returne) as <hi>Chaerilus</hi> did, who doth not thinke too well of himſelfe? nay who is there almoſt, that is not ſo farre gone this way, that he is not in loue with his own faults? which depraued blinde iudgment towards our ſelues may eaſilie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake vs, ſince we ſee that ſome haue bin blinded by reaſon of a fooliſh conceited loue, euen in the faults of others. As for example <hi>Alceus,</hi> of whome is that,
<q>Naeuus in articulo pueri delectat Alcaeum.</q> a wenne in his body ſeemed a grace to <hi>Alceus.</hi> As he for loue to his boy digeſted his impefection: ſo we for the like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ourſelues can diſpence with our greateſt faults, as if they were none. <hi>Roſcius</hi> was bleare eyed. <hi>Q. Catulus</hi> much more either bleared or blinded, when he took him to exceed<note place="margin">By God in that place of Tully is meant the Sunne.</note> God for beautie: but ſuch is the nature of loue, where it faſteneth, it will find no fault, eſpecially in our ſelues. In an old Greeke Epigram it is ſaid, that loue is nothing worth, nor to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, when one loueth a faire one, for that euerie bodie doth; to loue a foule droile or blouſe, this is loue indeede. Whence we may ſee how it fareth with vs, who think we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loue our ſelues enough, except we loue our faults and all. Leaſt therefore I my ſelfe ſhould fall into this confeſſed and deteſted vice of ſelfe loue toward my owne faults and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, I thought it my part to take the way, firſt to know what they were, or before they be knowne, they will hardly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<pb facs="tcp:8075:6"/> and a better or readier way to knowe them, I ſawe none, then by publiſhing my paines without name: for ſo both others will more freely perhaps, and more vprightly without partialitie iudge, and my ſelfe ſhall the ſooner heare what ſcapes ſhalbe charged vpon me. For this cauſe, and vpon this reaſon, I had, as I ſaid, reſolued at firſt to proceede with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie name: but afterward vpon ſome other iuſt &amp; vrgent occaſions, I was forced to alter this courſe, &amp; forſake my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer determination, and to hold the accuſtomed and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie courſe of publiſhing by name. By which courſe, although I faile ſomwhat of my former, and deſired purpoſe, yet I hope the point will not be greatly materiall, or with much diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage.</p>
                  <p>For the handling, and deliuerie of the matter, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to bee moſt ſimple and plaine, quite voide of that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, which ſome perhaps will looke for. I haue not ſought after vaine flouriſhes and rhetorications, nor had anie further care then this, that I may be vnderſtood. It fareth with ſpeech as it doth with a woman, the honeſter ſhe is, the leſſe care ſhe hath of her attire: it is the tricke of harlots to paint and beſmeare; <hi>Simplex eſt veritatis ſermo. Plato</hi> ſaith, that to be curious in words and phraſes, is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, baſe and ſeruile: with whom alſo iumpeth <hi>Galen,</hi> ſaying that the care of words, and contempt of matter came in together. Of which opinion alſo was <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> whoſe words are thus: He that careth for the truth muſt not buſie and trouble himſelfe too much about words, but be content to deliuer things as well as he can, for they that are curious in words, oft miſſe of the matter. With this agreeth that of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret de Morib. Graec. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pa.</hi> 10. Matter, ſaith he, and truth is to be preferred before words and phraſes: for want of faire words is no hinderaunce or diſgrace to the matter: the roſe groweth not on the faireſt tree, but on a prickly rude buſh. As good broth may come out of a woodden ladle, as out of a ſiluer ſpoone. A great admirer and reader of <hi>Ennius</hi> ſaid, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he read him, he gathered <hi>aurum ex ſterquilinio,</hi> according to that of an other, <hi>Ennius ingenio magnus, at arte rudis.</hi> If words
<pb facs="tcp:8075:6"/> will follow the matter they are welcome: but if they muſt be ſtudied for, fare them well: hee maketh ſmall account of his time that ſpendeth it about wind and words; and may be well compared to the dogge in <hi>Eſop,</hi> who ſnatching at the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, loſt the bone. Gay words without ſubſtance of matter, are like a painted ſheath with a woodden dagger, which will not cut, nor do anie office of a dagger: which I do not ſpeake in commendation of mine owne dagger, as if it were ſuch a cutter. I am not ſo far gone and paſt my ſelfe; neuertheleſſe I could wiſh, not onely that it would cut, but alſo cut off this vncouth kind of Figure-flingers, and ſtarre-gazers, who are ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l tooting on heauen, which belongeth full litle to them. Verie wiſe men haue bin verie careleſſe in this point of words and ſpeech. <hi>Porphyrie</hi> reporteth of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that when hee came to ſpeake or write anie thing, he was verie ridiculous, and that he did ſtutter like a babe. And <hi>Plato</hi> in his Apologie teſtifieth the ſame, that in his ſpeech he was without grace, or choiſe of words, with a rude vnlearned tongue. Now if <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> did practiſe, and <hi>Plato</hi> allow, I hope no bodie will exact or expect much of me: if anie do, I muſt anſwere only that,
<q>Quod decuit tantos, cur mihi turpe putem?</q> Wherefore that I may conclude with <hi>Socrates</hi> wordes in the ſame place, of you, gentle Readers, I requeſt only thus much, which mee thinke ſtandeth with reaſon, that you would not weigh my phraſe &amp; ſtile, though peraduenture it may pleaſe, and peraduenture no: for peraduenture it may be better, and peraduenture it may be worſe; but that you would weigh and well conſider this, whether I ſpeake to the purpoſe. Another thing wherein I am to craue the Readers pardon is, if that anie vnaduiſed or hard ſpeeches haue paſſed me, ſuch as are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to theſe contentious kind of confutations, and are wont commonly to ſcape many in their earneſtneſſe, and heat. How eaſie a matter it were for anie in an argument of this nature to let ſlip now and then an hard word, anie may iudge, if he liſt to conſider the groſſeneſſe of the fault, the multitude of the offenders, and the negligence of them that ſhould be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. For my part I cannot denie, but ſometime I was moued
<pb facs="tcp:8075:7"/> with it: yet ſo, I hope, as that neither I forgot the counſell of him, <hi>ammum rege, qui niſi paret, imperat:</hi> nor the good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of another, that being moued to wrath, ſmote himſelfe on the breaſt with a knocke, adding theſe words,

                        </gap> as if one ſhuld ſay, a loftie or mounted father, this title of loftie, or mounted father, being giuen him, becauſe hee lifted and mounted himſelfe from the earth by ſtudy of high and heauenly matters, ſearching what was the greatnes of the Sun, what was his courſe, how he doth determine the ſeaſons of the yeare, by his comming and going to and fro, ſearching alſo concerning the moon of her diuerſe lights, forms, waxings, wainings; of the motions of the other ſtars, both fixed, and not fixed. For (ſaith he) the ſtudy &amp; enquiry of theſe things is not baſe &amp; barren, but of al other moſt liberall, and full of good fruite, ſo that they bee referred as they ought to be to the vſe of life &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners. For ſaith he, as trees are nothing worth, vnleſſe they beare fruit: ſo Philoſophy auaileth nothing, if it bring not forth godly life, as her fruit. Inſomuch that ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring philoſophy to a field, haue likened the natural parts of it to the Plants; the logical part to the fence and hedges, but the morall to the fruit, affirming that the hedges &amp; fences round about, are made onely for the ſafty of the fruit, but the plants to bear fruit, ſo ſay they, muſt the natural &amp; logicall parts of Philoſophy be referred to the moral part, wherwith is taught ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation &amp; goodlife? By this place of <hi>Philo,</hi> we ſee both how farre <hi>Abraham</hi> waded in Aſtronomy, &amp; to what end. Thus hauing cleared him from the troopes of the enemie, it remaineth, that we leaue him
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8075:13"/> not ſo, but proceed in the purſuit. But firſt thus wee reaſon againſt theſe men. The hearts and wayes of all men are in the hands of God, who doth diſpoſe and turne them, as ſeemeth beſt to him, according to that, <hi>Pro. cap.</hi> 27. <hi>Homo proponit, Deus autem diſponit.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know his own waies for the time to come, much leſſe can the Aſtrologers know them. Againe, the diuell himſelfe knoweth not certainly future cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for if he did, he would neuer haue egged the Iewes forward to crucifie Chriſt, by whoſe death his tyranny ouer mankind was to be aboliſhed and diſſolued: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he be ſo buſie in tempting and moleſting the Saints of God, if he knew before he ſhould be foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them, and ſo increaſe their glorie. But what do we ſpeake of the diuell, ſeeing neither the Angels nor bleſſed ſoules of the faithfull, who ſtill behold God, and ſee into the courſe of ſtarres, as farre as any Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard, cannot certainely know our actions before hand, without ſome ſpeciall reuelation from God? What madneſſe were it then to giue that to the diuell, which is denied to Angels and Saints? Againe, whatſoeuer belonged to Chriſt, or the ſtate of his Church, we ſee hath beene euer foretold long before by the Prophets moſt diſtinctly and plainely; which things if they could haue beene foretold by the ſtarres and ſtarre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazers, then were the foundation of all true religion ſhaken. Neither by this meanes is religion and Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie ſhaken onely, but alſo all morall doctrine and philoſophie: for whoſoeuer is perſwaded, that all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on heauen, and therefore thinketh that all mens deeds and euents may be foreknowne and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by tooting vpon the ſtarres, he muſt needs thinke
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8075:14"/> withall, that the ſoule is mortall, and the prouidence of God not to be ſuch as our faith teacheth, and that the myſteries &amp; miracles of our religion, though they be indeed ſupernaturall, yet depend vpon celeſtiall cauſes and powers. How ill Chriſtianitie and Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie ſtand together, may appeare by the fact and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Epheſians, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. who as ſoone as they were conuerted by the Apoſtles preaching, bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to figure-flinging, and flung their curious books into the fire.</p>
                     <p>The ſpeech of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> receiuing a certaine pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent figure-flinger into the church, is very notable in theſe words after the expoſition of the 61. <hi>Pſal.</hi> This man being ſeduced by the enemy, was a long time a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure-flinger: being ſeduced himſelfe, and ſeducing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he deceiued, entiſed, &amp; ſpake manie lies againſt God, who hath giuen men power to do good and not harme. This man denied that his owne will commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted adulterie, but <hi>Venus:</hi> and that his owne will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted murther, but <hi>Mars:</hi> and that iuſtice was done, not by God, but <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and many ſuch blaſphemies did he vtter. And after a few lines continuing the ſame ſpeech, he ſaith: This man was loſt, but he hath beene ſought, and is now found &amp; brought home: the books that would haue burnt him, he bringeth with him to be burnt, that they being caſt into the fire, himſelfe may find refreſhing. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his booke <hi>de ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus</hi> telleth of a Biſhop that was depriued for ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing figure-flinging. Farther, all our religion, faith, the comming of our Sauiour, the labour and paines of his Apoſtles and Prophets in planting the Church, by this meanes ſhould be in vaine, vnleſſe ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8075:14"/> will not ſticke to ſay, that the miracles of Chriſt, with his death, birth, &amp;c. depend vpon conſtellations, and aſpects of ſtarres. And then wee may alſo go on, and ſay that we are by deſtinie called to Chriſt, and that either there is no difference betweene good and euill, or that God is the authour of euil. Some of them ſay there is ſuch vertue in <hi>Mars</hi> wel placed in the ninth houſe, that by our only preſence we chaſe diuels out of poſſeſſed bodies.</p>
                     <p>Others by this arte thinke they can iudge of mens thoughts and conſciences. <hi>Maternus</hi> ſaith, that they which are borne, <hi>Saturne</hi> being in <hi>Leo,</hi> ſhall firſt liue long here, &amp; afterward go to heauen. <hi>Albumaſar</hi> ſaith, that he that ſhall pray to God for any thing, when the Moone and <hi>Iupiter</hi> are ioyned in the head of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, ſhal obtaine whatſoeuer he asketh. Of this <hi>Petrus Aponenſis</hi> ſaith, that he had triall in himſelfe. For in that coniunction when he had asked learning of God, he perceiued, he ſaid, that he was thereby mightily furthered: yet I thinke that many haue had as much wit as he had, without asking: and of thoſe that haue asked without the help of that conſtellation, no doubt many haue far paſſed him for all manner of gifts. Wherfore it ſhould ſeeme that there be ſome conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations better for wit then this, for himſelfe it was wel that he asked in pudding time, as they ſay; for if he had not, perhaps we ſhould haue had a very wiſe man of him. But that it hath bin alwaies pernicious and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Church, may thence appeare, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the greateſt aſtrologers haue made religion, as well as any humane or politique lawes ſubiect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations. <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in the ſecond booke of his <hi>Centilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quium,</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:8075:15"/> aſcribeth to the nature of celeſtiall formes, &amp; ſtarres, that this motion hath one religion, and that another. And a certaine greeke interpreter of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> attributeth the miracle of Moſes paſſing the red ſea on foote with the people, to the skil of <hi>Moſes</hi> obſeruing the fluxe and refluxe of the ſea, as if in the ſame water both Gods people were not ſaued, and <hi>Pharao</hi> with his aſtrologers drowned, as if <hi>Ioſue</hi> had not paſſed Iordan drie foote, where was not fluxe nor refluxe to yeeld to him. <hi>Albumaſar</hi> deriueth from heauen both our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and all other lawes, and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter <hi>Henricus Macleuienſis</hi> found a ſhip in heauen, by which <hi>Noe</hi> framed his arke, which deuiſe <hi>Halliacenſis</hi> admitteth with great applauſe. <hi>Abraham Iudeus</hi> very impiouſly and ridiculouſly referreth to diuerſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the departing out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and whatſoeuer els hapned to that people. <hi>Guido Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mattus</hi> alſo moſt prophanely and madlie ſaith, that Chriſt vſed elected howers, when he anſwered the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, deſiring him not to goe into Iudea, that there were twelue howers of the daie. He made choiſe of an howre ſaith he, in which the <hi>Iewes</hi> could not hurt him, as if we did not reade in the ſame Goſpell, that he ouerthrew them, and paſſed through the midſt of them vnſeene, euen at none day. Others thinke that when they reade in <hi>Paul</hi> of the fulneſſe of time, and in the Goſpell, now is your hower, and the power of darkeneſſe, and in an other place my howre is not yet come, that by theſe places are meant their conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. For anſwer to them, I would gladly know of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether they thinke it eating time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are hungry, and drinking time when they are thirſty how
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8075:15"/> ſoeuer it fareth with heauen at the ſame time. If they be not ſtarke ſtaring madde, they will graunt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing hath a time, howſoeuer heauen goeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the thing in hand, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of Doing. So diuine miracles haue their time, but according to the purpoſe of God, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conſtitution of heauen. The ſame <hi>Guido</hi> ſaith, that the Chriſtian religion is the religion of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and in the proems of his <hi>Theorickes,</hi> againſt <hi>Gerar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> he writeth that wee muſt praie deuoutly to <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> in chooſing of a new Pope. <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> ſaith, that Chriſtians might doe well to keepe Satterdaie holie daie with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> beca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe it is no good day for worke, as belonging to <hi>Saturne.</hi> With the like madneſſe ſome of them haue ſaid, that <hi>Venus</hi> giueth felicitie in this world, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the world to come. Theſe things therefore being thus, who doth not ſee how Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and Aſtrologie will ſute together? how a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and an Aſtrologer cannot wel mantle in one coate? But for heretiques we knowe how well they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bin ſeene in theſe artes. <hi>Tertullian. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>contra Marcionem</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Marcioniſtes</hi> were commonly Aſtrologers, &amp; in his booke <hi>de Idololatria,</hi> he inueigheth mightily againſt them. They thinke ſaith he, that we are not to ſeeke after God, preſuming that the ſtarres raigne ouer vs, and force vs with an immutable decree. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith of <hi>Manes,</hi> that he was good at ſuch theſe magicall knacks, and ſtudied them hard. S. <hi>Auguſtine tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Confeſsionum</hi> ſaith, that the writings of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheans,</hi> were full of Aſtrologicall toyes, which they vnderſtoode not themſelues. As for <hi>Priſcillian,</hi> all knew how worthily he is condemned, for tying euen
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8075:16"/> our reprobation and election to the courſe of heauen and ſtarres. Of the Priſcillianiſts ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine cap.</hi> 70. <hi>de Haereſ.</hi> They affirme alſo that men are bound with certaine fatall ſtarres, and that our bodies are framed according to the twelue ſignes of heauen, as do they which are commonly knowne by the name of Mathematiques, placing <hi>Aries</hi> in the head, <hi>Taurus</hi> in the necke, <hi>Gemini</hi> in the ſhoulder, &amp;c. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſaith: Theſe fables, vanities, and ſacriledges doth this hereſie embrace. Wherefore by Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines</hi> opinion, theſe men may well be counted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques; whom, of the 12. ſignes which they abuſe, we may very fitly call <hi>Dodeafemoriani.</hi>

                     <p>Neither do I well ſee how that of <hi>Origen</hi> can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: where he ſaith, that this ſcience was permitted till the Goſpell came, that as ſoone as Chriſt was borne, none ſhould caſt natiuities by the ſtarres, <hi>lib. de Idolol.</hi> Much better is that ſaid of him in the ſixt Homely vpon <hi>Ioſuah:</hi> where among other ſhames and reproches of Egypt, he reckoneth vp Aſtrologie; and hauing named diuers, in the end hee inferreth thus: Which obſeruations if thou admit, and entangle thy ſelf with anew, thou doſt doubtles plunge thy ſelf into Egyptian reproches, if therefore, ſaith he, at any time this curioſitie tickle thee, by the inſtigation of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie in thine heart, ſay to thy ſelfe: I doe follow my guide Ieſus, in whoſe power are things to come, and what things ſo euer he will, thoſe things ſhall come.

And <hi>Ariſtotle lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Coelo, text.</hi> 17.34.60.61. confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in many of theſe points to be ſo far to ſeeke, that he is forced oft in ſteed of ſound arguments to vſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and coniectures. And if it fared thus with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the prince of Philoſophers, what is to bee thought of theſe companions, but euen that which is commonly ſaid, who is ſo bold as blind Bayard? No
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8075:17"/> doubt, there are in heauen a number of ſtarres, which, ſince becauſe of their diſtance, no man can diſcerne, no man can know, which notwithſtanding haue their operation. If therefore the ſtarres, which cauſe the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, be vnknowne, how can the effects themſelues be knowne, ſeeing euerie thing muſt bee knowne by his cauſes? Further, Aſtrologers confeſſe, that they haue no certaine knowledge, euen of many of thoſe ſtarres which are ſeene: how then can theſe paltry wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſards, of a few ſtarres, which they know, ſo confidently pronounce of things to come: as if by the influence of thoſe which they know not, the effects of thoſe which they know might not be hindered and altered? Vnleſſe perhaps to this they will anſwere, that the vnknowne ſtarres are without force or influence: which were moſt ſottiſh and abſurd. Among Aſtrologers it is plaine, that in the eight Spheare are ſtarres 1022. euerie one bigger then the earth; wherefore their force and power muſt needs be ſuch as the poore ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazers can hardly apprehend, conſidering their arte is bounded and limitted ſpecially &amp; principally, with the obſeruations of Planets only, their ſpending and occupying it ſelfe. But that the ſtarres haue no ſuch force or power at all, is plaine, for if they haue it, they muſt haue it of God; but of God they neuer had it, for then he would not haue forbidden the vſe of them, no more then he hath the vſe of meates, fruits, herbes, &amp;c. to which he hath giuen power to nouriſh &amp; cure mans bodie. As we are bidden to take meat and drinke with thankſgiuing: ſo no doubt he would haue willed vs to vſe the helpe of ſtarres, if there had beene anie ſuch force in them. But now that he hath forbidden
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8075:17"/> them, what ſhall we thinke? Againe, to what end had he forbidden the tree of knowledge, if he had left a ſtar of knowledge. The <hi>Magi</hi> were led to Chriſt by a ſtar, but not by a figure. Hence it is plaine that the ſtarres do not performe that which is ſaid; for were there not ſtarres enough before, but they muſt haue a new one to guide them? Will a figure mention the death of meane and baſe people, and ſay nothing of Chriſt? where, when, and how he was borne, but we muſt haue a new ſtarre? Although indeed <hi>Iulius Firmicus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. ſeemeth to be of opinion, that certaine perſons are ſo great, that the ſtarres do not reach to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuities and actions: his words be theſe. Only the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour is not ſubiect to the courſe of ſtarres, neither haue the ſtarres any power in his deſtinie: ſo that Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure-flingers and wiſards cannot certainely foretell anie thing either of the ſtate of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, or of the life of the Emperor. If this be true, great reaſon it is, that Chriſt ſhould be free from the neceſſity of ſtarres.

                     <p>About 22. yeares ago, 1578. was for halfe a yeeres ſpace together at leaſt, ſeene a new ſtarre in <hi>Caſsiopaea,</hi> which by the iudgement of all the beſt obſeruers of it, was out of the reach of Meteors, as being as high as the Sunne from the earth at leaſt. In this caſe we muſt gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t either that this ſtar was bred &amp; corrupted in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (which being granted, it will follow that the like may, and doth happen in others alſo) or that there be more Planets then ſeuen, whoſe courſes are vnknowne to vs; or laſtly that the fixed ſtarres do not keepe their eighth orbe, but haue their ſeuerall circuits and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                     <p>Concerning the aſpects, &amp; poſitions of ſtars in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuities, that muſt needs be a brittle, &amp; ſlippery point, very ſubiect to errour and miſtaking.

Secondly there is no leſſe difficultie in marking the aſpect of the ſtarre which was at that inſtant. For both the midwife may miſtake the time, and the Aſtrologer may miſtake the aſpect, by reaſon of interpoſition of fogges, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, which may either happily quite take away and hide, or at leaſt darken, and obſcure the aſpect. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that to be forgotten, that often times the ſwifte reuolution of the heauen cauſeth the conſtellation to be paſt before it can be noted, conſidering that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment the figure and face of heauen with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſtarres is varied.

For ſuppoſe one were borne ſuch a yeare, ſuch a day, ſuch an howre in the beginning or in the end of the ſame howre, yet that will not ſerue the figure-flingers turne, who muſt not knowe in a certaine latitude, but very exactly the very mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of time, which he is not to hope to learne of either midwife, or parents, who make their account ſo, that they thinke they come near, if they miſſe not too too much. Farther we may doubt, how the birth is to be taken, &amp; conſidered, whether when the child firſt ſheweth, or when it is half out, or when it is quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered. Neither can we exactly fit the time for any one of theſe. For either for the ſtoutneſſe of minde, or ſtrength of body, or diſpoſition of nature, or skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the midwife, the ſtrength of the child, or innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſuch like cauſes, euery one of theſe times may vary, to wit, both the time of pearing firſt, &amp; the time of farther bearing, and the time of full deliuery.

                     <p>By this relation to the twelft part, they noted the end by ſome faire ſtar, which they ſpied in the <hi>Horizon,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were North or South. By this help &amp; means they tooke vpon them to determine, and point out the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſions in the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> which notwithſtanding by no meanes are determinable, but ſo that a ſigne which is not riſen, may ſeeme to be riſen, and contrary a ſigne which is riſen, may ſeeme to be not riſen: neither will this way by water running ſo much further &amp; helpe them. For both the water it ſelfe, and the temperature of the ayre, and things ſtopping the fluxe, will cauſe the time of the running to vary and be vnequall. For it is like, that the water will run faſter in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, while it is cleare, then at the end, when it waxeth thicke, and muddy. For the ayre, it is like, if it be fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie &amp; thicke, it muſt needs hinder the running by a ſort of ſtopping it, but if it be cleare &amp; pure, it will helpe and further it. Againe the veſſell will not run a like faſt, being ful, and neere empty, but ſometimes ſlower, ſometimes faſter, the celeſtiall motions ſtill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame ſwiftneſſe, by this meanes they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thought to get the true <hi>Horoſcopus,</hi> and the aſcending ſigne of the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> in which how far they were deceiued may appeare, both by that which hath bin ſaid, and more at large in <hi>Sext.

For of them that haue beene borne together in the ſame time with ſome latitude of time, all haue not led the ſame life: but ſome of them, for example, haue reigned like Kings: others haue rotted in priſon. There were not many <hi>Alexanders,</hi> nor <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes,</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:8075:22"/> nor <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> at once, although no doubt manie were borne at the ſame time with euerie one of them. For beſide heauen, vnder which, as a generall cauſe, both the Philoſophers of Athens, and the hogs of Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia were borne, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had other more immediate and peculiar cauſes. For firſt he had both a good ſoule, and a good body, but of heauen neither, but as of an vniuerſall cauſe; for his ſoule, he had it of God, as hee had his bodie of his parents. He gaue himſelfe to phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, not forced by the heauens, but induced of his owne will. He alſo profited in Philoſophie excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, but that was by reaſon of his paines and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: but many that ſtudied as much, profited nothing like, that may be, becauſe he had a better maſter, and mo helpes. But he paſſed all his ſchoolefellowes and equals: for that no doubt hee had a better wit, which he receiued of God, not of any conſtellation. The like may bee ſaid for <hi>Alexander.</hi> His victorie againſt the Perſians, &amp; his good ſucceſſe againſt the Indians were maruellous. They were ſo, yet ſuch as no ſtarre but his princely vertues did effect; for he excelled in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Art Militarie, he had a notable Armie trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp vnder his father <hi>Philip,</hi> which for his bountie and vertues loued him moſt dearely. Againe, he had to deale with daſtardly people; ſo that his vncle ſaid of him, that hee fought with women, not with men. Wherefore if the figure-flinger giue the birth-time ſom latitude, he can neuer certainly ſay, that he which is borne at ſuch a time, ſhal be fortunate and happie, ſince many borne at the very ſame time, were verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie and miſerable. Neither on the other ſide can he pronounce him poore and needie that was borne
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8075:22"/> in ſuch an hower, ſince diuerſe borne in the ſame houre, liued all their life long in great abundance and plentie. Neither would it a little trouble the figure-flinger, if one ſhould retort the argument thus: If they which haue the ſame conſtellation, muſt needs haue the ſame haps and euents; then they which haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers conſtellations, muſt haue diuers and different euents and ſucceſſe, which is falſe. For we ſee many, though differing in yeares, bodily forme, and manie other wayes, yet haue come to the ſame end; to wit, either by fight in warre, ſhipwracke, fall of houſes, or ſuch like. Neither may they here reply, that ſome one, whoſe deſtinie was to be drowned, was the cauſe that all the reſt were caſt away with him. For why ſhould this mans deſtiny preuaile againſt the deſtinies of all the reſt? &amp; why were they not as wel all ſaued for ſome one mans deſtinie, who was to periſh by land? Laſtly, ſome haue gone about to entangle them with a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion or obiection of bruit beaſts. If the courſe of life and effects be guided by conſtellations; if in the ſame conſtellation be borne a man and an aſſe, they muſt both trie the ſame fortune of life, and not the man to be aduanced in honour and eaſe, the poore aſſe in the meane time carying burthens, and his backe full of ſtripes: therefore either our life is not guided by the ſtarres, or if it be, no body can tell how. Againe, while the child is in the mothers wombe, it is ſubiect to many diſeaſes and quames, I would aske the figure-flinger, if he can foretell the accidents; I would know of him alſo, whether he can tell what day, and what houre the child ſhall be borne: for theſe things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend as much of the ſtarres, as any thing after it is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8075:23"/> borne. Theſe things and ſuch like he muſt ſay either that hee can, or cannot tell. If he cannot, then wee haue our purpoſe: if he ſay he can, then wee aske him how: for the natiuitie hee cannot be guided by, which is yet vnknowne to him, the child not being yet borne.</p>

But they that know not the conception, they muſt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no flie to the natiuitie. <hi>Haly</hi> in his booke <hi>de Electionibus</hi> confeſſeth plaine, the effectuall way of telling deſtinies, to be in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception: which becauſe the Aſtrologers know not, they are glad to take hold of the natiuitie. Moreouer, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers are vrged with the obiections of twinnes, who though their birth be all one, yet often haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and contrarie euents, they are wont to anſwere, that the diuerſitie of euents in twinnes dependeth of their diuers conceptions. Notwithſtanding ſome of them will by no means admit the conception, becauſe no man is able to ſay, whether the conception went together with the ſeed or otherwiſe. For it may be in a moment, as when we ſee greaſe put into the fire, it by and by kindleth; it may be alſo ſome good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for the ſeed which is caſt in the ground, doth not by and by ſprout, and take roote in the clods. And ſince there is ſome diſtance betwene the mouth and bottome of the mother, where conception is made, the ſeed muſt haue ſome time for paſſing this diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; which time becauſe our <hi>Chaldeans</hi> knowe not, they can neuer rightly know the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception. And if, as ſome Phyſitians hold, there be a kind of concoction, and preparation required of the ſeed in the mother, before
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8075:24"/> there can be any conception: ſeeing theſe great craftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men know not how much time is neceſſarie and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to this preparation, they muſt needes be ignorant of the time of conception. Farther, as in other parts of their bodies women differ one from another, for the operations of the parts: ſo it is more then probable, that they haue the like differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mother, wherby ſome are more quicke, and ſome more ſlow in conception: and euen in one and the ſame wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it may be that ſhe is ſometimes more eaſie, and ſometimes more hard to conceiue, and ſometime will not conceiue at all. This being ſo, by no means can we exactly attaine to the time of conception, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might ſet a figure. Neither can it be ſaid, that the time of conception can be knowne by certain ſignes, as by the ſtraightneſſe of the mouth of the mother, by the ſtaying of the <hi>menſtrua,</hi> by their longing, &amp;c. for all theſe happen very commonly to them which haue not conceiued. But ſuppoſe they did not happen verie commonly, yet becauſe they ſignifie the conception, when many dayes are paſt, they can neuer bring vs to the true houre which we ſeeke. But the Aſtrologer to foretel the future caſualties of anies life muſt know the time not with a latitude, and gheſſe, but the verie inſtant, and perfectly. Hence it is plaine that the figure cannot be well framed by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ception, as much may be ſaid againſt the birth-time. But if they ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in theſe predictions the conception, then ſhould they be quickely at a ſtand, becauſe the time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is much harder to obtaine for the moſt part. It is alſo to be noted, that beſide the conception, the child hath diuerſe times of notable alteration before
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8075:24"/> the birth, which might ſeeme rather to be regarded then the birth: for at the firſt it is called for ſixe dayes ſpace <gap reason="foreign">

To euery one of theſe foure times, ſome, as <hi>Conciliator,</hi> and <hi>Aegidius Romanus,</hi> and ſome others, haue appointed a certaine number of dayes, which I meane not to ſtand vpon, as being a thing not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Galen.</hi> In concluſion, they adde out of <hi>Auicen. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de Animalibus,</hi> that the time of quickening is double to the time of forming; &amp; the time of birth double to the time of quickening.

Theſe times being thus notorious, and ſo limited, might ſeeme to giue as much direction as can be looked for of the natiuity: yet becauſe none of them can be obtained certainly, all men leaue them and fly to the natiuity: in which they thinke they haue great vantage, though it be far otherwiſe, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>Again, that which hath bin ſaid of the diuerſe times of the child in formation, may generally be proſecuted
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8075:25"/> thus. Of things which perfected in time, not in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or inſtant, the deſtinie muſt needs be doubtfull: of the which hower notwithſtanding they pronounce as definitiuely, as if there were no doubt. For that may be taken for the fatall hower, either wherein the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe beginneth the thing, or in which the thing is conſummate and perfected. Farther, wee are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that diuers partes haue their diuers beginnings, which are not finiſhed all at once, but one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in order, which in generall, as I ſaid, we may hold to be true in all things. Now in a man how many and how diuerſe fatal beginnings, as they terme them, may there be? As Firſt, when the man and woman lie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then with the ſeede which is admitted into the wombe. Thirdly when the ſeede worketh the womans excrement into a childe: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> milke is curdled with the earning: Fourthly when the childe is couered ouer with membranes and vilmes: Fiftly when the heart firſt appeareth: Sixtly when the ſoule commeth to it, which is the fitteſt time of all: Farther when it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be a man then it conſiſteth of matter, &amp; forme, which accompliſh the ful ſubſtance of it: The laſt time of al, &amp; the leaſt to be regarded is the birth-time. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this time as being no ſubiect to ſence, haue the Aſtrologers preferred and choſen as moſt fit for their predictions: but how wiſely, may eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; ſeeing time doth neither begin, nor make nor perfect a man, but only ſhew him to the world, being already made and perfected. For this cauſe no doubt <hi>Ptolemy</hi> attributeth more to the conception then to the birth <hi>apoteleſm. lib.</hi> 3. as hath bin alleaged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                     <p>But their vnſetledneſſe, and wauering in their owne art, may beſt appeare in ſicke men, whoſe recouery or Death they profeſſe to foretell. For that being a point depending vpon the natiuitie as much as any one thing: yet they leaue that commonly, and inſteed of it take the hower, when the ſicke man firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be ſicke, vpon which beginning they make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and doubtfull diſputes: ſome taking it for <gap reason="foreign">

For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two fall ſicke at once, the one of the plague, the other of the gowt, following this way they muſt needs both dye, or both eſcape, although we ſee how many die of the plague, and how few of the gowt. Againe, if this way were good, what an aduantage had the figure-flinger of all the world, who by taking his bed, when he liſt, might put off death for euer, if he would. For if he ſawe an ill hower, he might take another time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or later as he pleaſed, and ſo playe boe peepe with death. Here belike is true the meaning of that, <hi>Sapiens dominabitur aſtris,</hi> a wiſe man is aboue the ſtars.

For example, in a chicken are three notable times, the hatching, the laying of the egge, and the firſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. If a figure-flinger ſhould be asked the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of an hen, whether ſhee were to die at ſhrouetide, or by the foxe, or to be thraſhed to death: to anſwer the queſtion which of theſe three times would he take for ſetting his figure? Againe, the hen hatching all her young ones at once, let him anſwere whether they muſt all haue the ſame fortune; how many of them ſhould flye away with the kite, how many die of the pip or otherwiſe.

Farther I haue heard of ſome husbandmen, that one and the ſelfe ſame graine ſhooting out from his roote diuerſe eares, will yeelde ſome of them good wheate, &amp; other ſome ſmut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                        </q> For ſome in ſteed of a man will deſcribe vnto you a dawe, or ſuch like. One miſſing a ſiluer ſpoone, which was hidden by a Corniſh Chogh, which hee had in his houſe, and going to the figure-flinger to know what was become of his ſpoone, the figure-flinger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, the party which had it, had long legs, went in a blacke coate, with a paire of red ſtockings, he had a beake noſe, &amp; was borne weſtward from that place, he might ſeeme to be a gentleman by his high birth; but he thought no Engliſhma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reaſon of his ſtrange tongue. Now the Chogh indeed had long legges, red ſhanks, blacke feathers, a beake, was borne weſtward, and high, and in ſteed of ſpeach chattereth. With this blind deſcription many were called into ſuſpition, but the poore Chogh in the end was found to haue hid the ſpoone. This tale goeth for good with many: but I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8075:28"/> am out of doubt, that they cannot gheſſe ſo well. If they will get any credit to their gheſſes, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gheſſe at ſomewhat, that ſhall happen to morrow, or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, the euent whereof we are like to ſee, and as they carry themſelues in that, ſo truſt them in the reſt. If in theſe and ſuch like they ſhall faile, ſhall we bee ſuch puppies as to beleeue them in the reſt? As if they colde ſay true in nothing, but where they could not be controlled. If we were not too much beſotted, that which they ſay about windes and weather, as ſnowe, raine, froſt, drouth and ſuch others, might ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put vs in minde how to credit them in the reſt, and that there is no art in their predictions. How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doe they ſay falſe in theſe? And if at any time they ſaye true, yet it is ſo, that any man may ſee it was rather by hap then by skill. For if any vnskilfull man not profeſſed that way, ſhould ſet downe weather for euery day at all aduenture, we doubt not but he would hit ſometime euen as they doe. But the vanitie of their trade can no way better appeare then by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of diuerſe Almanacks together, where you may ſee, if you wil ſee, the exceeding folly of both parts, as well of them in writing, as others in beleeuing. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian Turnebus</hi> reporteth of himſelfe, that he was wont to make trial of their art. By this meanes many times (ſaith he) to trie their art, at the beginning of the yeare in a new almanacke, where they write raine, I write drouth: where they calme, I windie: where they cleare, I clowdie, obſeruing the euent, and at the yeares end, I gathered the ſum of both our predictions, &amp; found my ſelfe a great deale better, and truer Aſtrologer. Whereby we may ſee what a goodly art that is, which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8075:29"/> a man may ſeeme to haue by ſcoffing, and laughing at it, but what will bleſſed <hi>Cardan</hi> himſelfe ſay in this caſe? In his commentaries <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. his words be theſe of Aſtrologers, they handle (ſaith he) their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo careleſly, that they make the art to be great y ſlaundered. Since therefore their predictions are for the moſt part falſe, or rather all falſe, to ſpeake on, it is plaine they proceed not from any art, or certaine obſeruations, but of raſh and ignorant babling at all aduenture. Betwene art and hap hazard is this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the one hitteth oft, and very ſildome faileth; the other faileth commonly, and ſcarſe euer hitteth, no not one in a hundred. Now what reaſon is there, that one trueth ſhould credit ſo many lies, rather then ſo many lies ſhold diſcredit that one trueth, which might haue bin a lie, as well as the reſt, but that the blinde man ſometimes hitteth the haire. But ſince their lies are mo then their truthes, why may we not thinke that they hit vppon the truth, by chance? for when they conclude, that their art is good, becauſe ſometime they hit, by as good an argument, will I proue that all arts, be they neuer ſo ſuperſtitious &amp; ſottiſh, are good; for there is none of them, but if they be ſtill gheſſing, they wil ſometime hit. Wherfore if Aſtrologers ſhal conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne any diuining arts as falſe, they may be proued to ſpeake contradictories, ſince they may be all proued true, by as good reaſon as they bring for their art: but if againe they ſhall hold them all for true, they ſhalbe no leſſe ſubiect to contradiction. For ſuppoſe the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romancer, the Aſtrologer, and the Geomancer were al put to one queſtion, no doubt they would ſeeldome agree in the truth: and when any of them hapned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8075:29"/> the truth you ſhould finde it there, where you leaſt looked for it, either becauſe chaunce ruleth moſt, where there is leaſt reaſon, or becauſe in the worſe arts, the diuell is more ready to deceiue. For that of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> is moſt true, that Aſtrologers by the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the diuell, which they perceiue not, doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time tell the truth, which hapneth moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they ſeeme miraculouſly to foretell any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular euent. For <hi>Ptolemy</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that no man can foretell a particular without ſome diuine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Aſtrologers iugling in predictions, and our raſhnes in beleeuing, ſeemeth <hi>Tullie</hi> to haue touched very finely. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de diuinat:</hi> What needeth many words ſaith he, ſince we ſee daily theſe iugling companions conuinced? how many things haue I knowne them to aſſure <hi>Pompey, Craſsus</hi> and <hi>Ceſar,</hi> that none of them ſhould die, til he was old, at home, and with very good reputation, and famouſly? yet <hi>Pompey</hi> died in <hi>Egypt</hi> where he was beheaded: <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Senate by ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing: <hi>Craſſus</hi> among the <hi>Parthians</hi> with his whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Wherefore I cannot but maruaile ſaith <hi>Tully,</hi> if any liue, who will beleeue them, whoſe predictions are daily confuted by deedes and euents. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his booke entitled <hi>Ludus in mortem Claudij Caeſaris,</hi> by the way gyrding and ſcoffing at theſe vagabond lyers, maketh <hi>Mercury,</hi> perſwading the furies to kill <hi>Claudius,</hi> to vſe this reaſon, to wit, that theſe miſerable <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> may not alway lie. For they were wont yeare by yeare, and moneth by moneth to giue out the death of <hi>Claudius:</hi> his words are theſe: <hi>Patere iſtos mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticos aliqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do veru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dicere,</hi> which euery yeare, &amp; moneth, ſince he came to the ſtate, haue bin burying him, much
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8075:30"/> like this of <hi>Claudius</hi> is that which is written of pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the ſixt of that name, the Aſtrologers of that age were wont to giue out year by yeare, that he was but a dead man, and cold not paſſe ſtill the preſent year: yet, as it were in contempt of their predictions, he liued ſtill, and held out ſtrong and luſty. But in the yeare 153. theſe wiſe artificers changing their note, would now contrary bleſſe him with long life; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he ſhould liue long in great ſucceſſe, and proſperitie. But leaſt they ſhould be any whit truer in now propheſying his life, then they had bin before in propheſying his death, he died in the ſelfeſame yeare. See with what a full ſtreame and maine oppoſition <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> went againſt theſe liars. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>in Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em. Cap.</hi> 7. A little while agoe, ſaithe he, when there was great need of rain, one ſaid, lo now the new moon will bring ſhortly raine, and notwithſtanding our great want, yet I was loth that ſuch blinde aſſertions ſhould proue true. Finally I was very glad, that wee had no raine til it being obtained by the prayers of the church, gaue ſufficient proofe that we were not to rely vpon the change of the moone, but vpon the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and grace of the creatour. By this example the vanitie of Aſtrology was confuted, and the force of chriſtianitie and godly prayer confirmed. <hi>Albumazar</hi> referring all great chaunges to ten reuolutions of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,</hi> which is in 300 yeares, hath counted Chriſt to be borne 600. yeares after <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, in which computation he is about 300. yeares out. But no maruell of him, ſince he is ſo far out in a plainer computation of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the mathematique, making him one of the kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which raigned after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:8075:30"/> when it is well knowne to the contrary, that he was no king, and liued in <hi>Adrian</hi> the laſt time 160 yeares after thoſe <hi>Ptolemyes</hi> that were kinges of <hi>Egypt.</hi> It were infinite to lay their lies together: that one of 1588. may ſtand for many, and the rather becauſe it hapned in our memory. It were well that all of that trade had thoſe two figures. 88. ſeared in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, that when they meet, they might laugh one at another, as did the <hi>Aruſpices</hi> in olde time. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they might laugh, it was no laughing matter to the Catholike king, and his inuincible Nauie, who will be famous for that exploit till 88 come againe. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> belike thought, that this conſummation of 88 would be by water, and therefore very politike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they began to prepare for it betime, longer a great deale then euer <hi>Noah</hi> did for the flood. And ſure they might haue done well, if they had bin prouided of a pilot ſuch as was <hi>Hen. Nicholas in Chaucer.</hi> But it fell out reaſonable well with them, for they ſped almoſt as well in their <hi>Calloones,</hi> as if they had bin in his tubs. Some of theſe figure-flingers vpon their skil haue bin ſo confident, that before hand vpon their predictions, they would venter neuer to keep ſhop longer in that trade, if their predictions failed. Their predictions fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp; they haue bin as good as their word by neuer medling that way ſince.</p>

The Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers muſt needes ſay, that their predictions hold either in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie things, or in caſuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, or in thoſe things which are in our power. If they ſay in neceſſarie things, then are their predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in vaine, for that which hapneth neceſſarily, wee cannot auoid, but will we, nill we, it wil come to paſſe: whereas predictions are then onely auailable, when by them we can eſcape. Secondly, if they ſay in caſuall euents, then they do profeſſe an impoſſibilitie. For caſual eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are vncertain, but of vncertainties which may happen this way, or that way, there can bee no certaine or ſure prediction. It remaineth therfore that their predictions be in things, which are in our power: which alſo is impoſſible. For that which is in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8075:32"/> whether it ſhall happen or no, neither hath any further cauſe at the firſt, that can no man foretell: the Aſtrologers therefore haue no certaine ſubiect for their predictions. The ſame reaſon as ſerued <hi>Tullie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wiſards of his time, may likewiſe fit vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe, whom we now deale with, in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>de Diuinat.</hi> thence we reaſon thus: Aſtrologie auaileth neither where Sence, Arte, Philoſophie, or ciuill poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie is vſed, therefore it auaileth no where, nor in anie ſubiect. Firſt, for Sence: To iudge colours we haue our eyes: to iudge ſounds, our eares: for ſmelles, our noſe, and ſuch like. Neither were an Aſtrologer, if he were blind, able to iudge of colors: or if he were deafe, of ſounds, were he neuer ſo skilfull. As for matters of Art, who wold leaue the Phyſitian, to know of him what phyſicke he ſhould take, or what diet he ſhould keepe, or what veine he ſhould open, what humour he were to purge, and how much, and with what <hi>doſis,</hi> in what forme of purge, whether with pilles, potions, or bole, and ſuch like? The ſquaring of circles, the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of cubes, and ſuch like, haue alwayes beene left to the Geometrician. For Arithmetike, who euer went to him to learne to adde or ſubtract? For Muſike, to learne to frame his voice, to know how to diuide the Monochord, or whether <hi>Diateſſaron</hi> be a concord, or a diſcord? For Aſtronomie, to know of him whether the earth or Sun were greater? whether the interpoſition of the earth, be the cauſe of the eclipſe of the Moone? For Philoſophie, who euer went to them to know his dutie toward his friend or fo, kiffe or kin, prince or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect? How he was to frame a ſyllogiſme, what were the elements, whereof all things are made? What Prince
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8075:32"/> for gouerning his realm did euer vſe them, rather then wiſe and ſage Councellours? If the queſtion be of the beſt forme of gouernement, what lawes, what faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are fitteſt, who in theſe cauſes conferreth with the Aſtrologer, and not rather with the States-man? If for anſwer to theſe and the like obiections they ſhall tell vs that their predictions are in another maner of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, as in particular actions of men, depending vpon their natiuitie, who doth not ſee how they ſeeke ſhifts and euaſions, ſuch as at this time my leiſure can not ſtand vpon?

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:8075:38"/> 
                        <hi>Pollux</hi> twins alſo, yet not verie like in their courſes, the one being a good rider, the other good at buffets. No more it ſeemeth did this twinniſhneſſe worke in <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> whoſe ends, actions and enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes how ill they ſuted, appeareth at large in <hi>Halycar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſseus</hi> and <hi>Liuie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as the argument from the natiuity of twinnes is, as you ſee, verie forcible; ſo if we ſhould inſiſt vpon the conception, would it be more forcible? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of twinnes being in the ſame moment, there cannot be admitted any ſuch alteration in the poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heauen, but that the twinnes muſt needes haue all things alike and anſwerable: which becauſe they haue not, we may eaſilie eſtimate how litle is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to conſtellations. This argument from the conception is very militant for vs, vnleſſe ſome will flie to ſalue and ſecond it out of ſuperfetation, which is yet a doubt depending, and therefore not fit for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding of queſtions. For if it ſhall be ſaid, that the ſeed of twins is receiued at diuers times of ſome diſtance, I grant it may be ſo, yet I thinke it is more then they are able to proue, the mouth of the mother after concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhutting it ſelfe ſo cloſe, as may be, if we beleeue <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Aph.

Whereby it may come to paſſe, that they may haue ſuperfetation: yet both <hi>Plinie</hi> &amp; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> other where affirme that the Hare and Conie vſe ſuperfetation, ſo that after the conception of one, they will conceiue of another before they be deliuered of the firſt.</p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:8075:39"/>
                     <p>Alſo wee ſee it in many birdes: for example, Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, which being put together cocke &amp; hen, the hen will not lay anie egge till two moneths after; which proueth that euery egge is two moneths in perfecting; but after ſhe beginneth to lay once, ſhe will be ſcarſe two daies betweene euerie egge laying, which could not be without ſuperfetation. In women (ſaith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle Hiſt. Animalium</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) ſuperfetation happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not oft, neuertheleſſe ſometime it doth, and both liue, ſo that there go ſome reaſonable ſpace betweene the conceptions, after which maner Fablers do report <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Iphiclus</hi> to haue beene begotten. There was alſo (ſaith he) a queane, which lying with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and her man both on one day, brought forth at one birth, one like her huband, another like her man. Theſe and ſuch like are related both by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Pliny lib.</hi> 7. which are rare examples. But if one would contend, he needed not confeſſe that thoſe twinnes were got by ſuperfetation, although a great Phyſitian <hi>Eraſiſtratus</hi> affirmeth all twinnes to be conceiued by ſuperfetation. <hi>Hippo</hi> and <hi>Empedocles</hi> thinke they come at one lying together, by reaſon of the great quantitie of ſeede; <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> attributing it not to the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but quality and vertue of the ſeed. To theſe two <hi>Auicen</hi> addeth a third cauſe, that is, the ſhedding of the ſeed into the two ventricles of the mother, where are conceiued the two twinnes. But whether it be by the abundance, or qualitie, or diuerſitie of places, they muſt and are conceiued together, as the moſt &amp; beſt hold, without anie ſuperfetation. For if ſuperfetation be admitted, then the one is in danger to bane the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by his comming ſooner or later then his time, if
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8075:39"/> they come together; although we haue heard of ſome that haue beene deliuered of one after another ſome good time, according to the diſtance of their concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Here were alſo to be conſidered, that one ſide of the matrix is ſtronger then the other, both by philoſophie and phyſicke: which being ſo, though two twins ſhuld concurre in the time of conception, yet they might varie in their birth, that which were ſooner readie comming ſooner into the world. It is alſo known that a man-childe commeth faſter on to his pefection, ſo long as he is vnborne, though after birth contrarie, the woman ripeneth faſter then the man child: which being true, it muſt needs follow, that though a boy &amp; a gyrle were conceiued together, yet they might haue ſeuerall births, the boy being ſooner readie both by reaſon of his ſexe, and perhaps alſo for being concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger part of the mother. For thoſe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and as it were pararelled parts in the body, who can doubt, but they are the moſt preciſe and exact twinnes that may be; I meane the eyes, the eares, the armes, the legs, fingers, toes, and ſuch like. Both the eyes no queſtion are borne as iuſt in the ſame inſtant or moment as nothing can be iuſter, yet the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing, wee often ſee his fellow blinde, either by a reume or a blow, or ſome obſtruction of ſpirits, or ſuch like. How oft do we ſee the palfy poſſeſſe the one halfe only of the body both for motion and ſence, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the other halfe free? the one eare deafe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eare well: the one great toe gowtie, the other not; the one hand cut off the other hold on; the one ſide of the head troubled with the Hemicrania or Migram, &amp;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8075:40"/> not the other? Yet no twins came euer ſo iuſt together into the world, as theſe anſwerable parts doe one with another, eye with eye, eare with eare, and ſo forth in the reſt. Let any of our cunning men ſhew how theſe differences and diuerſities may bee deduced cleanly from the ſtarres, <hi>&amp; erit mihi maximus Augur,</hi> that is, as good a wiſard as the proudeſt of them all. As before we ſaid, that their continuall and common lying was ſufficient argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to proue that they had no ground of art; ſo now farther we ſay, that for lacke of ſufficient obſeruations they can haue no arte. For what if ſuch a man, borne in ſuch a conſtellation, had ſuch euents, will it therefore of this one obſeruation follow, that euerie one ſo borne ſhall haue the like? Nay, they muſt remember, that <hi>vnica hirundo non facit ver.</hi> Therefore that their predictions may be ſure &amp; firme, they muſt haue obſerued the ſelfe-ſame habitude of ſtarres, not once only in one mans birth, but againe and again di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe times, that ſeeing and obſeruing ſtill the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents in the ſame conſtellation, wee may learne that whenſoeuer the ſtarres ſhall be ſo placed, that then we are to looke for the ſame euents &amp; accidents. And as in phyſicke we learne that a wound in the heart is death, not onely becauſe <hi>Dio</hi> died of ſuch a wound, but alſo becauſe <hi>Theon</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> and diuers other died of the like: ſo in Aſtrologie we may beleeue that this figure of heauen hath this ſignification, if firſt it hath beene certified, and ratified by a multitude of conſenting ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations. Seeing therefore that the ſame figure of heauen commeth but once <hi>in anno magno,</hi> that is, in yeares 36000. in ſo many thouſand yeares, wee can make obſeruation but of one natiuitie, which alſo wil
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8075:40"/> be in great danger to miſcary, and to be loſt, by reaſon of ſo many decayes and ruines of the whole world, or at leaſt of the earth, either all at once or by peece-meale, in ſo infinite time. This deuiſe of <hi>Annus magnus</hi> ſome vtterly diſclaime from, as an impoſſibility, the motion of the ſtars being (as they alleage) incommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable, ſo that they can neuer all come to the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formation againe. But the lying of theſe mates lieth ſo open, that they neede neither me, nor any man elſe to confute or refell them. They babble much here of the long continuance of the Egyptians, that the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans had ſo plyed this caſe, that they had recorded in writing the natiuities of 407000. yeares, though to the contrary we know that it is not yet 6000. yeares com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete from the beginning of the world to this day. The originall of the Chaldeans, reckened fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of tongues, is not yet 4000. yeares paſt. <hi>Hipparchus</hi> and <hi>Ptolemie</hi> vſing the verie ancienteſt obſeruations that they could get, cannot get anie beyond <hi>Nabonaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarus.</hi> Theſe Egyptian antiquities are no leſſe pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then acutely confuted by Saint <hi>Auguſtine lib.</hi> 18. <hi>de Ciuit. cap.</hi> 40. Raſhly and vainely preſume ſome to ſay, that it is 100000. yeares ſince the Egyptians beganne firſt to obſerue ſtarres. But in what records or bookes haue they found this number, that receiued not paſt two thouſand yeares ago their firſt letters of Dame <hi>Iſis?</hi> Though proofes out of prophane Authours will not bee eſteemed of ſome, yet for the fanſie of a few I do not ſee why I ſhould forſake that courſe and way, wherein ſo many notable men haue gone before me, for to vſe that of the Poet,
<q>Quod decuit tantos cur mihi turpe putem?</q>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:8075:41"/> And ſince ſuch haue done it, <hi>ego homu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cio id non facerem?</hi> And manie graue and ancient Fathers giue vs this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to take from Philoſophers, whatſoeuer good thing we find in them as ſtray goods, and ſo to bring it home againe for our owne vſe, becauſe all truth is of God, whom we are to worſhip.

As of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi> ſo it is plaine of the whole ſect of Peripatetiques, in that they holde that heauen vſeth only theſe meanes in working, to wit, light, and motion. Euen <hi>Ptolemy</hi> alſo in certaine books <hi>de Fato,</hi> &amp; <hi>prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia</hi> yet extant, hath abundantly confuted theſe follies, ſhewing them not to be the cauſes of theſe effects, but ſometime per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to ſignifie, being but vniuerſall and confuſed ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whence procedeth a very deceitful and vncertaine coniecture. Wherefore <hi>Porphyrie</hi> writing his life, ſaith, that after long ſtudy of Aſtronomy, hee perceiued there was no truſt to be giuen to the doomes of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers, which is alſo proued plentifully by <hi>Auicen</hi> in the laſt booke of his metaphyſickes. <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> hath recorded a long and large diſcourſe of the great philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Phauorinus</hi> againſt <hi>Chaldeans</hi> the chiefe brokers and brochers of this art. <hi>Picus</hi> alſo ſheweth how <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes Laert. Seneca, Plutarch, Seuerianus,</hi> and diuerſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers both auncient, and moderne reiected theſe toyes, and in his laſt booke, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. he relateth that ſaying of <hi>Porphyrie,</hi> that then oracles did faile, and fitten, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would anſwere by Aſtrologie, which <hi>Porphyrie</hi>

This was faire warning and plaine dealing, and I thinke the trueſt oracle that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vttered. <hi>Alexander Aphrod.</hi> the chiefe interpreter of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> among the Greekes, writ a booke <hi>de Fato</hi> to <hi>Seuerus</hi> the Emperour &amp; <hi>Antonius</hi> his ſonne, in which confuting <hi>Fatum,</hi> he ſaith nothing of Aſtrology, which the very name of <hi>Fatum</hi> would haue forced him to, if he had not vtterly contemned it. In this iumpe with him the reſt of the interpreters, who, if at any time they name Aſtronomy, they ſhew that they meane on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which conſidereth the courſe of the heauens. <hi>Ammonius</hi> the interpreter of Porphyrie in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his worke, hath ſufficiently vttered his minde. <hi>Auerroes</hi> chiefe expoſitor among the <hi>Arabians</hi> euery where baiteth, and hunteth Aſtrology, affirming it to be no art, and the figures imagined in heauen, to be but a meer fable and a tale of a tubbe, without which notwithſtanding Aſtrology can hardly ſtand. It were infinite to recite the late Philoſophers that haue ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt this vanitie. That of <hi>Plautus Horentinus</hi> is worth the marking, he when he had liued 85 yeares, caſt his owne natiuitie examining it with as much art and diligence as he could, notwithſtanding he could finde no ſigne of long life in it. As for thoſe that haue written in defence or approbation of this art, either new or old, there is ſuch paucity, that you may wel ſay of them that: <hi>apparent rari nautes in gurgite vaſto,</hi> they appeare here one, and there one like drowned rats;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8075:43"/> otherwiſe they would neuer flye for ſuccour to thoſe counterfeits, to wit a booke of <hi>Ariſt.</hi> intituled of great coniunctions, and ſecrets to <hi>Alexander,</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his. With the like folly they attributed to <hi>Plato</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bookes, bearing the name of inſtitution bookes, ſtuffed with toies and trifles. Likewiſe they alleage a booke of <hi>Ouid de vetula,</hi> vpon which frier <hi>Bacon</hi> relieth much. They father alſo vpon <hi>Albertus magnus,</hi> and <hi>Tho.

Thus we ſee, what poore ſhift they make to ſaue themſelues, much like a man in drowning, who catcheth rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about at euery thing to help himſelfe. But they wil ſay, that they haue of euery ſide good Philoſophers, if we could hitte on them. As for example, <hi>Ptolemy, Haly, Firmicus, Albunaſar</hi> and others. For <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> as he was a rare man in mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques; ſo for this matter of aſtrology one ſaid very wel of him, that he was <hi>optimus malorum,</hi> that is, of bad the beſt; but for his philoſophy and vnderſtanding of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> diuerſe learned men haue taken exception for his diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of contemplatiue philoſophy in his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Almageſt into Theological, Mathematical &amp; Naturall, becauſe all things, as he there ſaith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of matter, forme and motion, which are ſeparable by thought only, and not in deed: farther yelding the cauſe, why the Moone is moiſt, he aſcribeth it to the vapours, which it draweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how much more moiſt ſhould the Sun be, which is knowne to draw infinitely more? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith that <hi>Saturne</hi> is cold becauſe of his diſtance from the Sunne; and Mars hot by reaſon of his vicinity. To which may be ſaid that of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8075:44"/> Mars hath his heat from the Sun, why is not the Sun as hot, or hotter then Mars? Theſe things are ridiculous in philoſophy &amp; not worthy confutation. Of <hi>Albuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> I haue ſaid before ſo much as may bewray his weaknes. For <hi>Firmicus</hi> as I haue ſaid in an other place, he is but a talker. He writeth that <hi>Mercurie</hi> in a night natiuitie may poſſeſſe <hi>medium coeli</hi> or the tenth houſe, whereas it is plaine, that <hi>Mercurie</hi> can neuer be there then. For euer on the night time the Sun is more then fortie degrees from any part of mid-heauen: and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi> is alwayes within thirtie degrees or thereabout of the Sun, for which cauſe he was wont to be called <hi>Pileatus,</hi> as wearing an hat to ſaue him from the heat of the Sun, which was ſo nere him. I haue in another place ſpoken of his wiſe opinion, how the ſtarres and heauen haue nothing to doe in Emperours natiuitie. <hi>Guido Bonatus</hi> feareth that the foure mathematikes can not ſtand, if ſtrology faile. But ful wiſely, as if he knew not the difference of Aſtrology and Aſtronomy, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſanes</hi> alſo a man very well learned in theſe points, hath a very good edge this way, as appeareth by <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Euang. praepar. cap.</hi> 8. becauſe the place there is very notable, I wil here ſet it downe: It is as followeth; Among the <hi>Seres</hi> the law forbiddeth murder, adultery, &amp; idolatrie, ſo that in thoſe countries is neither whore, theefe, nor murderer, neither doth the firie ſtarre of Mars in the middeſt of heauen there force any mans will to manſlaughter, neither could <hi>Venus</hi> in coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with <hi>Mars</hi> cauſe any to miſtreſſe another mans wife. Although it cannot be choſen, but that euerie day once <hi>Mars</hi> moueth to the middeſt of heauen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be denied, but in ſo great a country men
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8075:44"/> are borne euerie houre. Among the Indians and Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrians there be manie thouſands of thoſe whom wee call <hi>Brachmanni,</hi> who, what for tradition by fathers, what for lawes, neither worſhip images, nor eate any liue thing, neither euer drinke either wine or ale, but refraining from all euill, tend only vpon the ſeruice of God. In the meane time all other Indians their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie-men, wallow in murder, drunkenneſſe and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. There are alſo found ſome, or rather there is an whole nation in the Indies, dwelling in the ſame cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, which hunting and ſacrificing men, deuoure them: neither do anie ſtarres, bee they neuer ſo good, keepe them from bloud and villanie, neither anie ſtars ſo bad, that they can make the <hi>Brachmanni</hi> commit fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. By the lawes in Perſia men might marrie their daughters and mothers: neither did they this in Perſia only: but when they change their country and climate they retaine and vſe theſe abominations; for which cauſe other countries deteſting their filthines, call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Maguſſaeos.</hi> And there be to this day in Egypt, Phrygia, and France, many of theſe <hi>Maguſsaei,</hi> which by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their fathers are ſtained &amp; polluted with this geare. Yet we cannot ſay, that they were all borne in the houſe of <hi>Saturne,</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> being in coniunction with <hi>Venus.</hi> The Amazones haue no husbands, but in the ſpring time go to their neighbour countries, &amp; lie with the men: ſo it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that by the courſe of nature they muſt all bee deliuered at once, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the males, they bring vp only the females, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all warlike by a great care of actiuitie. It were folly to thinke that all theſe women were borne vnder the ſame conſtellation. This may be fortified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8075:45"/> by the example of the Iewes, who liuing diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, continually circumciſe on the eight day, &amp; reſt the Sabbath day. Now all the Iewes had not the ſame poſition of heauen in their natiuities, neither could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny celeſtial power hale and pull them from the rites and cuſtomes of their fathers. But what ſhall wee ſay of Chriſtians, who being ſcattered infinitely all ouer the world, keepe the ſame kind of life, and doctrine, from which we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be moued a whit with rewards, threats, or puniſhment? Will they ſay that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had one <hi>Horoſcopus?</hi> But that of all others is moſt forcible, that they which before their conuerſion were moſt earneſt in the waies of their anceſtors, after they were once conuerted, changed religion, maners, kind of life ſo cleane, as if they had neuer beene the ſame men. Wherefore ſo manie Parthians as be Chriſtians keepe not many wiues, nor the Medes caſt their dead to the dogs, nor the Indians burne their dead, nor the Perſians marrie their daughters and ſiſters, nor the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians worſhip the dogs, or Apes and ſuch like, but in all places they follow the ſame lawes, rites and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. To be ſhort, daily men are borne euery where, and euery where we ſee them obſerue their own lawes and faſhions; neither do the birth-ſtars force the <hi>Seres</hi> to commit murther, or the <hi>Brachmanni</hi> to eate fleſh, neither can they reclaime the Perſians from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous mariages, nor the Medes from caſting their dead to the dogs, nor the Parthians from multitude of wiues: for all nations as they liſt, &amp;c. when they will vſe their libertie in obeying their lawes and cuſtomes, Hitherto <hi>Bardeſanes.</hi> With like arguments to theſe, you might fill whole volumes, and ouercharge the world.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8075:45"/> Ethiopians were all blacke, were they belonging to one conſtellation? Farther, it is no fable which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of Hermophrodites, which play both the man and womans part, as they liſt, and at their choiſe. Such are the people beyond the <hi>Naſamones,</hi> and their next neighbours <hi>Madians,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Calliphanes:</hi> and ſuch bee found alſo in Europe, not only among the people cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lumenſes,</hi> among whom it is ſeuerely looked to, &amp; prouided, that euery one ſhall at the firſt chuſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſexe hee will, and hold himſelfe to it in paine of death: muſt theſe therefore for this conuenience be all borne vnder one ſtarre? And ſhould not the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation make Hermophrodites here as well as there? The like may be ſaid of the great people called <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpi,</hi> who are all borne with one eye only, which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Euſtathius</hi> vpon <hi>Dyonyſ.</hi> doth refer not to the ſtars, but to their winking of one eye when they ſhoote: for with much winking in aiming that eye waxed leſſe, firſt in the fathers, then in the ſons, then in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo ſtill leſſe and leſſe, till at laſt it was quite out, and ſo continued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herodotus</hi> in <hi>Thalia</hi> reporteth that the braine or ſculs of the Perſians were ſo ſoft and tender, that one might pierce them with a ſmall peble ſtone; but the ſculles of the Egyptians ſo hard, that they would not breake with a great ſtone, which difference he referreth not to any conſtellation, but to the diuerſity of education, the Egyptians vſing to ſhaue their heads, and go in the ſunne, whereby their ſculs were hardened: the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans contrarie, neuer ſhauing, but keeping their heads warme with caps and tires.</p>
                     <p>Therfore we may ſee that there is more required to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8075:46"/> the conueniences and differences, then the poſition of ſtarres according to that of <hi>Ariſtotle, Sol &amp; homo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant hominem,</hi> not <hi>Sol</hi> alone, nor <hi>homo</hi> alone: whence it will follow, that for the foreſeeing of future effects, there is more required then the knowledge of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall cauſes. Philoſophie teacheth vs, that <hi>vt res ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet ad eſſe, ſic ſe habet ad cognoſci,</hi> that is, by what cauſes any thing is made, by the ſame it muſt be knowne, if we ſeeke for ſure and certaine knowledge.</p>
                     <p>With thoſe prophane teſtimonies alleaged a little before, agreeth that of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes cap.</hi> 7. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. For who can ſhew what is good for man in the life, and in the number of the dayes of the life of his vanitie, ſeeing he maketh them as a ſhadowe, for who can ſhew vnto man what ſhall be after him? What a vaine queſtion were this, if euerie Aſtrologer could by caſting of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuities, and ſetting of figures foretell our actions and accidents. But more vaine were it if that braſen head made by <hi>Albertus magnus,</hi> &amp; placed in his ſtudy could anſwere <hi>ad omnia quaeſita,</hi> as is reported by <hi>Toſtatus, Num. to.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 22. <hi>col.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>This head by like was wont to tel ſchooletales, and therefore S. <hi>Thomas</hi> his ſcholler getting into his ſtudy, fell vpon it, and brake it, and defaced it: this head was made by Aſtrologie and arte magike, as witneſſeth the ſame <hi>Toſtatus.</hi> He alſo relateth the like of another brazen head ſhrined at Zamara in Spaine.

After that, how many yeeres <hi>Nicias</hi> had like to haue marred the Athenian ſtate, for not knowing the cauſe of the eclipſe of the Moone, you may ſee in <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Plinie.</hi> Before <hi>Platoes</hi> time there is ſcarſe mention of any that tooke anie thing vpon him in theſe predictions. <hi>Eudoxus Gnidius, Platoes</hi> great acquaintance and friend, hauing conuerſed long with the Egyptians, where he attained to the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Aſtronomie, and Aſtrologie, expreſſely diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8075:51"/> the latter, and firſt of his nation, gaue himſelfe wholly to embrace and ſtudie the former. No Grecian is recorded to haue giuen himſelfe ſo throughly to theſe ſtudies. He did ſo diligently among the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, obſerue the courſe of the ſtarres, that the high place where he made his ſtanding to note them, euen in <hi>Straboes</hi> time, was called <hi>Eudoxi ſpeculae,</hi> that is, <hi>Eudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xus</hi> beacon. This man among the Grecians, is ſaid firſt to haue beene skilfull in this arte, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he is reported to haue condemned, becauſe he found it ſtill falſe and fickle. If one thing onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a hundred fell out true, hee did not vſe that to make good all the reſt that were falſe, but contrarie, rather diſcredited that one for the reſts ſake. He knew that one ſhooting all day muſt needs ſometime hit the marke, were he neuer ſuch a bungler, and that in oft caſting the dice, where there is nothing but chaunce, one ſhall ſometime turne vp that chance which they call <hi>Venereus.</hi> As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirmeth nothing of <hi>Thales</hi> skill: ſo if <hi>Eudoxus</hi> had knowne any ſuch memorable skill to haue beene in <hi>Thales,</hi> he would not haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it, comming welnigh three hundred years after him. But this ſtorie of <hi>Thales</hi> is by <hi>Pliny</hi> reported of <hi>Democritus,</hi> ſo full of vncertaintie is the whole matter. Theſe things would haue bin conſidered of them that ſlaunder <hi>Thales</hi> with Aſtrologie.

For example, one had it not in his natiuitie, to haue a worthy ſonne, but rather a baſe child, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like a profound clarke, he made choiſe of a good hower to lie with his wife. By this meanes he framed himſelfe a new deſtiny, which he had not before, and by this new deſtiny that became deſtiny to him, which was neuer his deſtiny by natiuitie. O madneſſe of all madneſſe! we muſt take heed what day we marry one. Belike leaſt for lacke of heed and choiſe, we ſhould light vpon a diſmale day. But by this meanes what is become of our birth conſtellation? can a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by choiſe of a day alter his deſtiny, &amp; ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not another power alter that which he hath choſen?

                     <p>But to leaue <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> euen <hi>Ptolemy</hi> confeſſeth, that if thy natiuitie be againſt thy enterpriſe, the elections

To this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futing them out of their owne principles muſt be added that of <hi>Alpetragius,</hi> teaching, that if there be a motion in heauen yet vnknowne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is a body yet vnknown too for that motion: which opinion may alſo bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by thoſe motions, which haue of late bin diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by our moderne Mathematiques, which they ſay their predeceſſours neuer knew. Now for the ſight and order of the planets, how doe they agree? while they that follow the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> place the moone next &amp; immediatly vnder the Sun, as doth alſo both <hi>Plato</hi> &amp; <hi>Aristotle.</hi> For <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his booke <hi>de coelo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Timaeo</hi> placeth the Moone next to the Sun, ſtill vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Moone to be the loweſt of al the planets. <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and the latter men place the Sun in the middeſt of the planets, thinking that place meeteſt for it, as King ouer the reſt. <hi>Geber</hi> and <hi>Theon</hi> in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries vpon <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> hold that the Sun is nere the Moone. <hi>Andreas Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marius</hi> holdeth <hi>Saturne, Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> to be higher then the reſt: but which of them among themſelues is higheſt or loweſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is knowne (ſaith he) nor can be knowne. <hi>Moſes Egyptius</hi> ſaith, there is no certaintie, what is the order and ſite of the planets, eſpecially of the three vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the number of ſpheares aboue the planets, what doutfull worke haue they made, ſome holding the eight ſphear, in which are the fixed ſtares, to be the vttermoſt: others imagining a ninth orbe to compaſſe the eight which is inuiſible: ſome alſo ſuppoſe ther is a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8075:55"/> tenth ſpheare vtmoſt of all. The authours of the firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion were the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> after embraced and <hi>Hipparcus,</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy:</hi> the ſame was laſtly maintained by <hi>Leo Hebrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> &amp; <hi>Proclus</hi> the Platonike. The ſecond opinion follow moſt of our modernes, as <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> who firſt made ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of planets by this ſphear, thinking it to be the vttermoſt. Of the ſame minde were <hi>Leopoldus, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hala,</hi> and <hi>Campanus,</hi> and <hi>Albertus,</hi> all fathering this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion vpon <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> but falſely: for with him is no ninth ſphere, much leſſe any tenth, as you may perceiue both by the ſecond booke of the Almageſt, &amp; the firſt book of <hi>Apoteleſmata.</hi> For ſince <hi>Ptolemy</hi> vſeth both the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable ſignes, called the images, or the figures of the eightſphear, and the immouable ſignes, referring to them the places of the planets, is ſufficient proofe, that he dreamed of nothing, without the eight ſpheare. For thoſe foure famous points, to wit, of the two tropicks, &amp; two equinoctial he calleth the immouable ſignes, which are fixed and faſtned in the eight ſpheare, not in the ninth; for theſe be his words in the ſecond booke of the Almageſt; I will a buſe the names of the ſignes, applying them to the partes of the <hi>Zodiak,</hi> as if they began at the tropick and equinoctiall pointes, ſo the twelfth part from the vernall equinoctiall toward the ſommer tropick, I will call <hi>Aries,</hi> the ſecond twelfth part, or <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, I will call <hi>Taurus,</hi> and ſo forth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the twelue ſignes deliuered by vs. And in the firſt booke of his <hi>Apoteleſmata,</hi> he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth the partes of the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> to which he referreth the planets, by the Solſtitiall, and Equinoctiall points, but be there, or be there not any ninth ſpheare, all the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8075:56"/> Aſtrologie of our age muſt needes downe. For if theſe celeſtiall influences proceede from all parts of heauens, it will follow, that they can prognoſticate nothing, which make no account of the whole Orbe, as if the bare places where no ſtarres are, had no force or power. But if theſe celeſtiall influences to change things here, proceede only from ſuch ſtarres as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with euident light and beams, then muſt they of force grant, that no force deſcendeth from the ninth Sphere hither, which either hath no light at all, or ſuch as cannot be perceiued. Wherefore either the whole Sphere is to be obſerued, which they do not, or that ninth Sphere, if there be any ſuch, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, of which mind is <hi>Guido Bonatus,</hi> affirming that whatſoeuer is aboue the eight Sphere, belongeth not to the Aſtrologer. Farther, we are to note how they iarre not onely in motions, &amp; reuolutions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, but euen of the Sun it ſelfe, how diuerſely and contrarie they write. Before <hi>Hipparchus</hi> time they held that the Sunnes reuolution, which is a yeare, contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only 350. dayes, and a quarter of a day. <hi>Hipparchus</hi> thought the addition aboue euen dayes was leſſe then a quarter. <hi>Ptolemey</hi> thinketh that leſſe to bee the 300. part of a day. <hi>Albateguinus</hi> ſaith, it wanted of a quarter the 106. part of a day. <hi>Thebit</hi> ſaith, that the yeare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth 365. dayes, 6. houres, 10. minutes, 12. degr. <hi>Philolaus</hi> ſaid that the naturall yeare conſiſted of 364. dayes and a halfe. Others in a matter of ſuch vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, though they came neere enough, if they made the yere of 365 dayes, which opinion Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſeemed not much to miſlike, who in his Commentary <hi>ſuper Geneſim,</hi> to the 365. daies addeth the whole quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8075:56"/> day. When we ſee theſe great men thus varie and diſſent, wee need maruell leſſe at the Arcadians, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king yeeres of three moneths long: and at the Acarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who vſed yeares of ſixe moneths; and Greekes hauing yeares of 354. dayes. As they diſſent much in the quantitie of the yeare: ſo is there as il agreement in the beginning of it. But that this point cannot be determined of, <hi>Ptolemie</hi> proueth in the ſecond booke of his <hi>Apoteleſmata</hi> for this reaſon, becauſe in a circle no man can find a beginning ſimply. Wherfore in the Zodiak are imagined foure beginnings by coniecture, the two Solſtitial, and the two Equinoctiall pointes. The Egyptians began their yeare at the vernall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial, the Romans at the winter Tropicke: others at the firſt of <hi>Libra.

If any, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this controuerſie, ſhall ſay that we are to heed the creation of the world, he ſhal rather increaſe, then diminiſh the controuerſie. For among the Hebrewes, where this were to be learned, is no certaintie to be found, ſome of them holding that the creation was in the Srping; others in Autumne: of which opinion are many, for concerning the celebrating of the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the firſt moneth, that they ſay was ſpoken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the ſolemnities.

                     <p>For anſwer to the firſt reaſon, where it was ſaid, that the leape yeare changeth the nature of things, we ſay that it is moſt falſe: for neither could I euer obſerue it
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8075:65"/> in any, and this preſent 1600. being leape yeare, doth ſufficiently conuince the contrarie. For wee ſee the courſe of nature by that means nothing interrupted or changed, for we continue all ſtill as wee were laſt yeare, men are men, and women are women ſtill, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are fruit, or beaſtes, or bathes, or children euer a whit weaker or worſe then they were other yeares. So that the leape yeare for any thing I ſee, might well vſe the defence of merie <hi>Skelton,</hi> who being a Prieſt, and hauing a child by his wife, euerie one cryed out, oh <hi>Skelton</hi> hath a child, fie on him, &amp;c. Their mouthes at that time he could not ſtop: but on a holy day in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mood, he brought the child to Church with him, and in the pulpit ſtript it naked, and held it out, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; See this child, is it not a pretie child, as other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be, euen as any of yours, hath it not legs, armes, head, feet, limbes, proportioned euery way as it ſhuld be? If <hi>Skelton</hi> had begot a monſter, as a calfe, or ſuch like, what a life ſhould poore <hi>Skelton</hi> haue had then? So we ſay for the leape yeare, if it had changed the nature of things, as it is charged, how ſhould it haue done then to defend it ſelfe? If the nature of any thing change in the leap yeare, it ſeemeth to be true in men and women, according to the anſwer of a mad fellowe to his miſtreſſe, who being called knaue by her, replied that it was not poſſible, for ſaid he, if you remember your ſelfe, good miſtreſſe, this is leape yeare, and then, as you know well, knaues weare ſmockes. But for farther anſwer, we muſt tell them, that the leape yeare is no worke of nature, but <hi>ex poſitione humana,</hi> at mans appointment and pleaſure. Wherefore, ſince the leape yeare is but an humane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution, it cannot be that it
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8075:66"/> ſhould change the nature of things.</p>
                     <p>For the obiection of ſhepheards and Fruterers, we ſay, that it is but a lewd ſhift of craftie hinds to deceiue their maſters, bearing them in hand, that their things are dead, when they haue ſtolne them.</p>
                     <p>For the obiection of women with childe in thoſe yeares, it is of ſmall force, conſidering how timerous and fearfull they be, and how naturally giuen to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
                     <p>Whereas they goe about to proue that the leape yeare is Saturnine, by the working of melancholie, which is euery fourth day, the anſwere is plaine, that melancholy in working obſerueth the fourth day, as we ſee in quartaine agues: but in <hi>Saturne</hi> it is nothing ſo, who leapeth rather by fiue: for ſtill after three or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie yeares complete, commeth the fourth leape yeare, otherwiſe quite then in a quartaine ague: where we ſee continually but two good daies, and the third euill, and yet it is called and counted a quartaine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am not ignorant that countrey people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call it the third day ague. The like groſſeneſſe is committed, when they ſay, that the Moone by her moiſture raigneth ouer flegme, and the ſea: which if it were true, why ſhould we not haue two fits euery day of a quotidian, as we haue two ſea tides.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the leape yeare being but a humane conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it had a time when it began, before that time when there was no leap yeare, nor intercalating, what was to be ſaid then? And if we ſhould not intercalate euerie fourth yeare, but euerie eight yeare, putting in two dayes, or euerie twelfth yeare, putting in three dayes, ſhould only thoſe yeares bee bad and diſmall?
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8075:66"/> And now that the Pope intercalateth certaine dayes ſooner then we, and at euery 130. yeares, quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then we, will that make no alteration in the leap yeare? Againe, why may not any other of the three yeares be the fourth yeare as well as the leape yeare?</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>alen</hi> the firſt authour, and founder of criticall dayes <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de diebus criticis,</hi> hath related to vs two lunarie influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the one by reaſon of the ſun, of whome the Moone borroweth her light; the other by reaſon of the ſignes of the <hi>Zodiake,</hi> which ſhe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through once monthly. Then he ſetteth downe as both allowed by Aſtrologers, and confirmed by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that the Moone in oppoſite, and quadrangular aſpects, either in reſpect of the Sun, or in reſpect of the twelue ſignes, doth make great alterations in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangular diſtances fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the change ſhewing half only, and in oppoſite diſtances the whole at full, and ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth the ſtate of the aire. Farther, he affirmeth the ſame alterations to happen to things, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Moone commeth to the quadrangular, and oppoſite places to thoſe where it was, when any thing was bred or borne. For example: If any thing began to be, the Moone being in <hi>Taurus,</hi> it ſhould vndergoe theſe alterations, when the Moone is come to <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Aquarius,</hi> which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8075:67"/> are ſignes quadrangularly reſpecting <hi>Taurus,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he confirmeth with the authoritie of the <hi>Egiptians.</hi> Hence he thought to find the certaine and ſure cauſe of criticall daies, eſpecially ſince the ſeuenth and the fourteenth dayes are holden as principall critikes; becauſe in the ſeuenth day the Moone commeth to the fourth ſigne, from that which it was in at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the diſeaſe: and in the foureteenth day, to the oppoſite place of the ſame, in which two places, becauſe the Moone is wont to make ſtirres, it falleth out that in thoſe daies likewiſe the diſeaſes be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and buſie to death, if the diſeaſe be dangerous: but to good helth, if it be otherwiſe. Now <hi>Galen</hi> being deſirous to proue not only the 21. as <hi>Archigenes</hi> would haue it, but the twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tieth alſo to be critical, he fetcheth that from the courſe of the Moone, which goeth round once euery 27. dayes eight houres: which time is called <hi>menſis peragrationis,</hi> and <hi>periodicus,</hi> that is, the peragration moneth. Then parting this moneth into foure equall parts, he alloweth to euery quarter ſixe dayes twentie houres, ſo that the 21. day by the courſe of the Moone belonged partly to the 21. day natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, partly to the twentieth. For his twelue firſt houres ended &amp; concluded the twentieth day, the reſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the 21. day. This being thus, he concludeth that criticall motions fall vpon the twentieth day in long diſeaſes, which proceed by numbers equall to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, the Moone comming to his ſecond quadrangle, in that number of daies: And againe, vpon the 21. day naturall in ſharpe diſeaſes which keep od dayes. <hi>Galen</hi> being come wel, as he thought, thus far, proceded far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to contradict <hi>Archigenes,</hi> namely, that no part of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8075:67"/> the 21. day ſhuld be criticall, but the whole twentieth day only. Wherefore he tooke not the peragration moneth, as we euen now called it, but that which is from change to change, conſiſting of 29. dayes twelue houres, which of the learned is called <hi>menſis coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> and <hi>menſis ſynodicus,</hi> and of vs may be called the change moneth. Againe, from the 29. day twelue how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he taketh away thoſe three dayes, wherein the Moone commonly is hidden, and darkened in the change, becauſe he thought it did not worke vpon theſe inferiour matters for lacke of light. So there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of that moneth only 26. dayes, twelue howers, which is wont to be termed and knowne by the name of <hi>menſis illuminationis:</hi> &amp; we may cal it the Apparition moneth. Now this and the peragration moneth he put together, and made vp 53. dayes, and twentie howers: Then taking the halfe of this time, he made a month of his owne, containing 26. dayes, &amp; 22. howers. This new kinde of month they are wont to call <hi>menſem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinalem,</hi> that is, the phiſitians moneth, being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of thoſe dayes which the Moon hath light in, and in which it paſſeth round the Zodiake: as if this month ſhuld containe the influence of the Moone two waies, both in reſpect of the Sunne, and in reſpect of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diake. By this account <hi>Galen</hi> had his purpoſe, ſince the weekes or quarters of this containe ſixe dayes, ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene howers and an halfe. So it came to paſſe, that the third quarter of the Phyſitian moneth ended with the twentieth naturall day, within foure howers and a halfe, which were put ouer to the 21. day. But all this pain <hi>Galen</hi> might haue ſaued, ſince by the peragra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion moneth alſo the 20. day fell to be criticall, as was
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8075:68"/> ſaid: and he himſelfe doth not denie, but the 21. may be criticall, eſpecially in ſharpe diſeaſes. This haue I ſaid, leaſt when I haue ſhewed, that the criticall dayes cannot be referred to the Moone, whether we weigh her vertue by the Sun, or the ſignes, it might be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that we had not fully ſatisfied, becauſe <hi>Galen</hi> had found out a compound influence to make criticall daies by, which things notwithſtanding either he hath not done, or if he hath done it, yet hee did it without reaſon, as ſhall diuers wayes bee proued, for if theſe ſtirres, as he calleth them, happen when the Moone is in quadrangular or oppoſit ſignes to the place where any thing had his beginning: and againe, when it is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate with quadrangular or oppoſite Sun-beames, we ought not to expect theſe euents from the Moone: but at ſuch times as it is placed one of theſe waies, if ſo be that we look for thoſe euents from thoſe cauſes. But if we looke for them from the Phyſitians moneth, and from the halfes, and quarters of that, they ſhall not depend of thoſe cauſes, which <hi>Galen</hi> hath proued to raiſe and breede thoſe ſtirres: For then thoſe cauſes are not. Abſurd therefore and ſottiſh is it to ſay, that the vertue of both the conſtellations are mingled at that time, when none of thoſe conſtellations are found. Wherefore if this criticall power be ſought of <hi>Galen</hi> in the quarters and halfes of the Phyſitians moneth, and not in the quarters and halfes of the peragration moneth, and moneth of illumination, it ſhall not at all be found in Aſtrologicall influences. For neither can you bring it to the ſquare, and oppoſite ſignes, neither to the quadrangular or oppoſite ſites of the Sun. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it can neither be made nor preſerued at ſuch time
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8075:68"/> as theſe are not. Againe, according to <hi>Galens</hi> moneth, the thirteenth day rather then the fourteenth, ſhould be criticall, for that hath thirteene houres, whereas this hath but eleuen houres. Wherefore you that bee ſticklers for <hi>Galen,</hi> how will you here defend your ſelues, vſing the peragration moneth, not <hi>Galens,</hi> when you will make the fourteenth day criticall, but contrarie, when you will make the twentieth day cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, leauing the peragration moneth, and falling to the other of <hi>Galens</hi> deuiſe?</p>
                     <p>Farther, if one ſhuld ſicken the day before the Moone began to bee in change, hauing the 7. day after for his critick, this by no meanes could depend either vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sun, or vpon any ſigne, ſince the Moone for the moſt part of that time was darkened. So that euen by <hi>Galens</hi> iudgment it could not affect, or worke vpon vs. Moreouer, this counterfeit moneth of <hi>Galens</hi> neither agreeth with nature, and ſuppoſeth that the Moone is hid three daies from the Sun, which all men knowe to be falſe, and is againſt experience. Farther, it will follow, that (if thoſe dayes be ſtanding and fixed) the Moone ſhould goe alwaies alike faſt, not one while ſlower, and another while faſter. Which to bee moſt falſe, is plaine by Aſtronomicall computations. And who knoweth not that when ſhe goeth in her epicycle <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, with the Center, of the Eccenter, ſhe goeth faſter then when ſhe goeth <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which motion muſt needes abate from her ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But that the criticall dayes are not guided by the courſe of the Moone, whenceſoeuer they haue their vertue from Sun, or ſignes, is hence plaine. For if they had it of the Sun, it would follow, that we muſt ſtill
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8075:69"/> fall ſicke at the change of the Moone. For otherwiſe vpon the ſeuenth day the Moon could not be halued, nor at her ful light vpon the 14. day, in which, he ſaith, diſeaſes are prouoked by reaſon of quadrangular and oppoſite configuration with the Sun: but if they haue their force from the ſignes, we may reaſon thus. The 7. &amp; 14. day, as thou ſaiſt, hapneth the prouocation, but commonly the Moone vpon theſe dayes is not in the ſquare &amp; oppoſite places, therfore from the Moon, by reaſon of thoſe places, cannot that commotion or prouocation proceed. The Minor of this ſyllogiſme is plain to all that haue but the leaſt skill in the courſe of the Moone: for ſometime it commeth to the ſquare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vpon the ſixt day, and to the oppoſite ſigne vpon the 13. day, and ſometime it commeth not before the eight or 9. day to the ſquare aſpect. Neither are theſe criticall dayes altogether guided by this motion: and if they were, yet the manner of them would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then is preſcribed. Therefore diuers haue giuen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes of criticall dayes, which depend nothing of the Moone. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> for the Moone is vtterlie ſilent, referring all rather to certaine numbers obſerued by nature, as both <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> and <hi>Celſus</hi> haue noted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Auicen</hi> quite reiected this lunatique opinion for the great vncertainty of it, as doth alſo <hi>Auerroes</hi> in his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liget, ſhewing withall, that to medle with cauſes of criticall dayes, doth not belong to the Phiſitian, but to ſome higher philoſophy; the phiſitian ought only to know which are criticall, and how he is to handle his patient, when he perceiueth, and foreſeeth the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall day: Wherefore in this point we may ſafely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Galen,</hi> but not in the other; both becauſe he was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8075:69"/> deceiued, as hath bin proued, and becauſe his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and authoritie in Philoſophy is not much ſet by, euen of ſome of his beſt friends: for both <hi>Auicen,</hi> and <hi>Rabby Moſes</hi> gaue out, that hee did but flutter in the bowes of arts, and neuer came at the root. Oftentimes alſo he faileth in logike, and naturall philoſophie, and in his diſcourſes of <hi>motus</hi> and <hi>anima.</hi> How ſlenderly he was ſeen in Aſtrologie, may appeare by his computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he maketh of the courſe of the Moone: and <hi>Conciliators</hi> defence of him, is, that in his time the motion of heauen, and that skill was very gazen, and ſcarce well found. Farther, he plainely refuſeth to giue the reaſon, why the Moone ſhould haue any ſuch force in theſe quadrangular and oppoſite ſignes, alleaging only the authoritie of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> whome notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the ſixt booke of Simples he taunteth and condemneth as doters. Neither could they be obſerued of ſuch as neuer well knew the courſe of the Moone. For <hi>Hipparchus</hi> of Rhodes was the firſt that in this point came any thing neare the truth: after him <hi>Ptolemy</hi> did better, yet ſo that the <hi>Arabians</hi> did not allow of him. Our moderne maſters (the courſe of the Moone being better found,) haue picked a new reaſon out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſignes, which agreeth neither with the truth, nor with <hi>Galen,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they follow, nor with their poſitions, which they defend. The quadrangular and oppoſite ſignes, ſay they, haue contrary qualities (they meane for heat, cold, drineſſe, and moyſture,) either both, or the actiue qualities at leaſt. Then going on, they farther ad, that the quadrangular, and oppoſite aſpects are contrarie. Vpon theſe ſuppoſitions they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that when the Moone is come to theſe places,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8075:70"/> which are contrary to thoſe which it was in at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the diſeaſe, then nature &amp; the diſeaſe ſtriue. For example, (ſay they) if the Moone be in <hi>Taurus,</hi> when one falleth ſicke, when it commeth to the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangular, or oppoſite place, to wit, <hi>Leo</hi> or <hi>Scorpius,</hi> then is deadly feid betweene the diſeaſe and nature. Hence we infer, that the Moone will much more doe it, when ſhe is in <hi>Gemini,</hi> which differeth from <hi>Leo</hi> more then <hi>Taurus</hi> doth, the like will fall out when ſhe is in <hi>Libra,</hi> which differeth from <hi>Taurus</hi> more then doth <hi>Scorpius.</hi> This argument, or conſequence, is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued euen out of the Aſtrologers themſelues. For by their poſitions, the ſign of <hi>Taurus</hi> is dry &amp; cold; <hi>Leo</hi> dry and hot; <hi>Scorpius</hi> drie and cold; <hi>Gemini</hi> hot and moiſt. To this perhaps they will reply, that theſe ſignes are not ioyned by any aſpect. Againe we proue that there is no contrarietie in theſe places. For if they be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the Moone by their poſition ſhould ſhew this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie effect, as ſoone as it came to any place of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie qualitie: but it commeth from a cold and drie place to an hot and moiſt, &amp; yeeldeth not the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie effect, therefore this poſition falleth. Now if they will ſay that the force conſiſteth in the aſpects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they ought conſequently to holde that the Moone comming to trigonall ſignes ſhould fortifie the diſeaſe, becauſe there is as much force to concord in triangles, as to diſcord in ſquares; for as by reaſon of diſcord of qualities, quadrangles ſtir vp the diſeaſe, ſo by reaſon of concord, triangles ſhall not ſtir them vp. This being thus, that will follow to croſſe the rules of Phiſitians, that the 11 day will be hurtfull, which notwithſtanding is otherwiſe by their rules, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8075:70"/> that the Moone the 11. day almoſt groweth trigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Farther, it cannot be (as Phiſitians hold) that the ſixt &amp; eight day among the reſt, cauſe ill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motions, for this were againſt Aſtrologie, which vpon thoſe dayes bringeth the Moone to ſquare aſpects. Againe, why count they the tenth day &amp; twelfth hurtfull, the Moone then not being placed in any aſpect with the ſigne of the diſeaſe? But neither by reaſon of ſun, Moon nor conſtellation, can they finde any cauſe why the criticall daies ſhould be ſometime euen, ſometime od. For to let the reſt paſſe now they make the 41. day criticall, after that they drawe in euen dayes, the 60, the 80, and the 120. then they goe by moneths and yeares. For the conſtellations in theſe times doe much vary, as the aſtrologers ſay, whereas the phiſitians will haue their criticall dayes to be ſet, continuall, and vniforme. To ſhut vp this diſcourſe, let vs heare the ſhamefull errour of <hi>Conciliator,</hi> the malice of the ſixt day which <hi>Galen</hi> compareth to a tyrant, as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day to a king, may be (ſaith he) reduced to the Moone, which commeth with more ſpeede to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragonal aſpect. The goodneſſe of the ſeuenth he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vpon the nature of the tetragonall, which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the ſigne of the diſeaſe. So from the ſquare he deriueth both the malice of the ſixt, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſeuenth. Farther the circuit of humours he reduceth to the ſtarres; the ſloweſt circuit of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly (for that lieth quiet two dayes) he referreth to <hi>Saturne;</hi> choler he aſcribeth to <hi>Mars;</hi> flegme to the Moone; blood to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> but how fondly, now ſee. The blood putrifieth without any pauſe, therfore his circuit ſhould by their rule be aſcribed to the ſwifteſt planet,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8075:71"/> not to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> which, if you conſider his reuolution, is the ſloweſt of all ſauing <hi>Saturne.</hi> Againe, if that be true, that the operation of the ſlower ſtarres be ſlower pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to their ſlowneſſe, then choler ſhould make a longer fit then flegme, becauſe the reſtitution, or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of <hi>Mars</hi> is much ſlower then the Moones. Notwithſtanding the flegmatique fit is much longer then the fit of choler, for this latter is twelue howers, the other is eighteene howers long. Hence is cleare that the courſe giuen to flegme, doth better fit blood: for whereas it reſembleth the motion of the ſea, which ebbeth and floweth, ſcarſe putting any time betweene, that doth better agree to blood then flegme, which is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual motion as the ſea is, in which the litle time betweene the ebbing and flowing, can by no meanes anſwer to the ſixt howers reſpite in a flegmatike ague. Laſtly, if flegme anſwered to the water, then in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiefoure howers, it ſhould make two periods of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the ſea doth, which we ſee doth not anſwear neither. Farther, there is more reſemblance, &amp; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene the earth and the water, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth and fire in reſpect both of motion, qualities, and place, and becauſe they be (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) <hi>ſymbola.</hi> For the earth is cold &amp; drie; the water cold and moiſt; the fire hot &amp; dry; the firſt two deſcending, the fire aſcending, which alſo is in the higheſt ſpheare, as the earth in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, with the water next it, and then the ayre.

Firſt becauſe there is ſuch varietie, or rather confuſion of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of heauen, &amp; heauenly cauſes, that the knowledge of them is altogether impoſſible, and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for three cauſes; namely, firſt for the multitude of ſtars; ſecondly by reaſon of the proper force of euery ſtarre, ſigne, and part of heauen; thirdly by reaſon of certaine altetations which happen to the planets. For the number of the ſtars, we know they are ſo innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable &amp; incomprehenſible, that no man is able to ſay what portion of them is, whether the one halfe or the third part, quarter, or ſuch like. Yet Mathematicians in this point haue defined thus far, that if all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauitie of the eight ſphere were filled with ſtarres <hi>primae magnitudinis,</hi> it would containe 71209600, that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8075:76"/> is 70 millions, 209 thouſand, and 600 ſtarres. Now ſince the Aſtrologers haue noted in their catalogue as knowne onely 1028 ſtars, they muſt needs confeſſe that they proceed by the help of a fewe, and a ſmall part of heauen, making the knowledge of the reſt to be idle as it were, and to no purpoſe, and meaſuring the knowledge of thoſe, which are knowne onely by the view of the eye. For whereas they attribute the firſt 4. qualities to the planets by their light, greatneſſe, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and diſtance of the fixed ſtarres, they do not ſo determine, but of them pronounce by their colours, this to be of the nature of <hi>Saturne;</hi> another of <hi>Mars;</hi> another of <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſo forth. Farther, it is agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the Aſtrologers and Mathematicians, that <hi>Saturne</hi> in bulk containeth the earth 91 times; <hi>Iupiter</hi> 95 times; <hi>Mars</hi> once and halfe; the Sun 167 times; <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the 37 part; <hi>Mercurie</hi> the 21 part; the Moone the 39 part. Moreouer they affirme, that the ſtarres of the firſt greatnes, as they terme them, doe containe the earth 107 times; of the ſecond greatneſſe 90 times; of the third 70 times; of the fourth 54 times; of the fift 35 times; of the ſixt 18 times, which notwithſtanding are the leaſt that can be diſcerned by the eye. So the whole number of ſtars diſtinguiſhed by their bulk and greatneſſe is 1008; to which if you ad 5 moe called <hi>nebuloſos,</hi> and 9 called <hi>obſcuros,</hi> you haue the full num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of noted ſtarres 1022. Nowe if in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the hugeneſſe of theſe bodies, mans witte fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; if in ſo great diſtance all wax dim to him, how ſhall he bee able to iudge any thing at all of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, qualities and powers? The Sunne and Moone, ſay they, worke vpon theſe inferiour matters; but the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8075:76"/> other ſtars haue the ſame nature &amp; ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the other therefore worke and gouerne in the ſame manner. Be it ſo then: yet the operations of the Sun and Moone are euident, &amp; nothing belonging to predictions. And whereas they ſay the other ſtarres are of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the Sun and Moone are of, their meaning (I thinke) is, that they are hote, bright, celeſtiall, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and ſuch like. But here the queſtion is not of the nature of the ſtarres, but of their effects. But grant that not only the Sun and Moone, but alſo all other ſtarres worke, what skilleth their working, if we know not what they worke? But in that they ſay all worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of the ſame nature, doth moſt of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue predictions, ſince they cannot tell the force of any one ſtar, much leſſe the number of all. Farther, the difference of ſignes is ſo manifolde, and infinite, that no man is able to comprehend them. As for the errour which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by the alteration of their forces, which followeth cheefly the varietie of the motion of the planets, that of all others is the greateſt. The reaſon and neceſſitie of this errour riſeth hence, that this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration reacheth ſo farre, that the planets by varietie of motion remit, or intend, not only their proper, and eſſential force, but often quite change it to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, becomming of good bad; of fauorable maligne; of fortunate diſmall, and contrarie. Hence come thoſe idle names of retrogradation, ſtation, velocitie, longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, latitude, aſpect, combuſtion, direction, progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, reuolution, and ſuch like, with a great many more then I haue named. Another chiefe cauſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologicall lies is, that by reaſon of their infinite vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, thoſe things can neuer be comprehended, which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8075:77"/> do remit, change, and aboliſh the force and working of the ſtarres, as in their generall predictions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Empires, kingdoms, countries, nations, townes, that generall mutabilitie, and inconſtancie of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour world being alwaies mutable and tranſitorie. In the natiuities of men, the nature of the ſeede, the accidents in the womb, the birth houre, nouriſhment, education &amp; inſtitution, the will, aduiſe, and ſuch like, which are not to be neglected, but diligently waighed. Of thoſe things that go before the natiuitie, although I haue ſaid ſomwhat before, yet it will not be amiſſe to heare what <hi>Ficinus</hi> ſaith vpon a book of <hi>Plotinus</hi> intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Vtrum ſtellae aliquid agant,</hi> the things to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered are in number fiue. Firſt the nature of the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; the ſeed, &amp; ſowing time, which ſeed &amp; ſowing time depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more of the nature, imagination, and voluntarie motion of parents, then of any conſtellation. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, the time when the ſeed in the mother waxeth ſtiffe, &amp; glewiſh, which alteration in the ſeede followeth the condition of the ſeed &amp; parents, rather then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of heauen. Thirdly, the time of quickening, which is not in all alike, but in ſome ſooner, in ſome later. Fourthly, the time when the child before birth, ſtriueth and ſtrugleth to vntie and free it ſelfe from the bondes in the mothers wombe, which loſing lieth more in the ſtrength of the child, and mother, then in the habit of heauen. Fiftly, the time of birth, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth cheefly of the force and ſtrength of the child, and mother. Againe, the poſition of heauen was not the ſame at the conception, quickening, and birth. By which differences, if the temperament and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of our bodie be altered, then muſt needs the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8075:77"/> Aſtrologer hold himſelfe not to the bare conſtitution of heauen in the natiuitie, but fly withall to theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, and not pronounce any thing before hee hath conferred all the times together. But as theſe times, and their cauſes are vnknowne; ſo eſpecially we cannot tell what is made of them being all put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Whence muſt needs proceed errour, which the Aſtrologers notwithſtanding either knowe not, or diſſemble, ſuppoſing the birth hower alone to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for their predictions.</p>
                        <p>In the education is to be conſidered the diuerſitie of countries, and cuſtome; for in England, Italie, France, Spaine, &amp; Germany, is not the ſame maner of education: ſecondly is to be conſidered the varietie of feeding. Neither do all of the ſame countrie vſe the ſame diet and feeding, but rich folkes one way, and poore folkes another, and in deed euery one as they can. Now if hee bee deceiued both in things before births, &amp; in births, &amp; in the education after, how can he euer iudge aright of the temperament, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth rather to the phiſitian, then to the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For the phiſitian by probable ſignes iudgeth the temperament not only of the whole bodie, but of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part, as if he ſee one given to anger, rage, brawling, he by and by iudgeth him to be cholerick; if dull, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, drowſie, flegmaticke, whereas the Aſtrologer iudgeth of choller by the conſtitution of <hi>Mars;</hi> of melancholie by <hi>Saturne;</hi> of blood by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and ſo in the reſt. Yet this mad ſtuffe they ſeeke to fortifie out of one or two miſconſtrued places of <hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſo ridiculous &amp; far from the purpoſe, that they bewray their owne pouertie too much: but they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8075:78"/> that lacke better fewell, muſt burne ſuch as they can get, if it be but ſheeps trundles and cowdung.</p>
                        <p>Next education commeth inſtitution, whoſe force is not only confeſſed of all wiſe men, but proued by experience. By inſtitution and gouernment a man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten imbraceth not that which the Aſtrologers picke out of heauen, but that which their parents, friends, Tutors &amp; Guardians ſhall thinke fitteſt, or that which themſelues loue. It often falleth out, that a man borne to learning and philoſophie, by inſtitution is made a ſouldier; and he that was a ſouldier naturally, is aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be a king. Many that are naturally naught by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution are reclaimed. <hi>Zopyrus</hi> reading the deſtinie of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and vttering manie things contrarie to his vertues, was hiſſed at for his labour of the by-ſtanders: but <hi>Socrates</hi> anſwered for him, that naturallie he was ſuch a one, if good bringing vp had not got the vpper hand of nature. So long as <hi>Nero</hi> hearkened to <hi>Seneca,</hi> he was well accepted and taken of all.</p>
                        <p>Next to our bringing vp come our actions, deſires, and buſineſſe, in which is chiefly to be conſidered the cuſtome of countries, which we know to be guided, not by any naturall neceſſitie or power of ſtarres; but by lawes cuſtoms, examples, diſcipline, by the qualitie and oportunitie of the place, or by a mans owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation &amp; opinion. Where there is no puniſhment, there euen the better ſort will offend: but where there is ſharpe and due correction, euen the naturally bad will refraine from offence. By imitation of the good many daily become good; and ill by imitation of the ill, what ſtarre ſoeuer they be borne vnder. So for oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and opportunite, no ſtarre maketh fiſhers and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8075:78"/> hunters, where there is no occaſion of fiſhing &amp; hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Againe, what ſtarre ſoeuer men be borne vnder, they will fall to fiſhing and hunting, if occaſion ſerue, and need force them.</p>
                        <p>Now thus much hauing beene ſaid generally of thoſe things, which not onely trouble, but quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the iudgement of Aſtrologers, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe to ſhew what not onely ancient <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe later men of the ſame profeſſion, <hi>VVolphius, Pontanus, Ficinus</hi> and <hi>Cardan</hi> himſelfe haue thought in this point. Not far from the beginning of the firſt booke of the Quadripartite, <hi>Ptolemies</hi> words are theſe; Concerning natiuities, and ſeuerall temperaments, manie other things concurre, which alter the caſe in mixtures. Firſt, the diuerſitie of ſeede hath great force to bring foorth of his owne kinde; ſo great, that in the ſame aire, and horizon, euerie ſort of ſeed holdeth to his own kind; mans to men; horſes to horſes. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I remember that <hi>Ludouicus Viues</hi> in his firſt booke <hi>de anima</hi> reporteth it to bee very ordinary with the women in <hi>Naples,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Belgica Batauia,</hi> hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of their husbands, to bring forth verie mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous beaſts, which he imputeth partly to their diet, and feed, as being much vpon Cabbage, and ſuch like; and partly to ſome imperfection and vncleanneſſe of the mother. For by the like imperfection wee ſee the earth alter, and corrupt the ſeed caſt into it, bringing ſuldars and ſmuttie geare in ſteed of good wheat. But of this I haue ſaid before cap. 7. Againe the diuerſitie of countries cauſeth no ſmall difference in natiuities, though the ſeed be of the ſame kind, as of diuerſe men: and though the ſtate of heauen be the ſame, yet by
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8075:79"/> diuerſitie of countries, here is great difference both in mindes and bodies. Farther, though theſe things were not, yet education and cuſtome would cauſe great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. A little after his words be as follow; We may not thinke that all things happen to men from heauen, as it were by an immutable and diuine decree, or by a law that forced particulars, &amp; could not be reſiſted, for the courſe of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is for euerimmutable, but theſe inferiour things are natural, &amp; mutable. As for men, to them happen many things by reaſon of a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, not for any proper qualitie of the particular nature; as when by reaſon of great chaunges, or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the ayre, which can hardly be auoyded, as it falleth out in great drouthes, plagues, deluges, where we ſtill ſee the inferiour and particular cauſes giue place to the ſuperiour, and more generall. By theſe places of <hi>Ptolemy</hi> we may perceiue, that though a man by his particular natiuitie, is to liue ſo long, or to die thus, yet if there come a peſtilent conſtitution, it may ſweepe him away with others, before the time by his natiuitie. Why? becauſe that peſtilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution hath a more generall, and mightie cauſe, which muſt needs ouerſway the particular cauſe of the natiuitie. So if there be an hundred in a ſhip, who by their ſeuerall natiuities, ſhould all die at ſeueral times, and ſeuerall deaths: yet they are often all caſt away at once, by reaſon of the generall and ſtronger cauſe which raiſed the tempeſt, and preuaileth againſt all the particular cauſes of their ſeuerall natiuities. The like may be ſaid of other cauſes. But to return to <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> againe, in the third book of the <hi>Quadrip.</hi> his words be theſe: The vniuerſall cauſes are of more force and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8075:79"/> efficacie, then particular cauſes. Which words of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemie</hi> manie learned Mathematiques, Philoſophers, &amp; Aſtrologers do ſo interprete, as if particular predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were nothing worth. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the reſt <hi>Pontane</hi> hath theſe words: They which deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to particular predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are derided of <hi>Ptolemie</hi> himſelf, becauſe it cannot be, but that their coniectures and obſeruations muſt needs faile in this behalf. Of the vſe of Aſtrology <hi>VVol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phius</hi> ſaith: By the circumſtances of regions, countries, lawes, education, parents, times, place, that which was decreed by the ſtarres, is often changed, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. There is ſuch an intricate varietie of humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, trades and caſes, that it is impoſſible to pierce and enter into the particulars. Againe, the ſame authour: Neither in the meane time can we denie, but there are very plauſible arguments brought againſt the art, for example, the ſwiftneſſe of heauen, the vncertaintie of the conception, and birth hower, the diſſimilitude of maners, and fortune, of twinnes, which follow the one; the other in no more diſtance perhaps then we may erre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point of the natiuitie, either by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or difficulty of obſeruation. To theſe ad ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, fires, ſacks of cities, plagus, deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of whole armies; for it is not like that ſo many thouſand had the ſame <hi>Horoſcopus,</hi> or that their conſtellations agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame hower: farther we may conſider the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities of a number borne at the ſame time, either in the ſame place, or diuers, of which ſome proued Kings, ſome beggers, ſome learned, ſome rude, and idiots, ſome men, ſome women, ſome tall, ſome dwarfes, with innumerable ſuch differences. To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Ficinus</hi> vpon <hi>Plotinus:</hi> To conclude, ſaith he, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8075:80"/> the matter goeth, it is very hard to iudge of things to come: for if we know not what new thing is made by the mixture of naturall things, much leſſe do wee know what new thing riſeth by the proiect of the ſtar-beames.</p>
                        <p>Certainely, when the Aſtrologers confeſſe, that by the coniunction of two beams, another thing is made then by one beame alone, they muſt needes farther confeſſe, that by the medly of the beames of all the Planets, is bred a far other matter, then when two only ioine. Which hapneth alſo much more, when not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the Planets, but the whole infinitie of ſtarres concurre. But when mo cauſes concurre to an action, the harder is the iudgement, becauſe neither are all the cauſes comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, neither if they were all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, doth it by and by appeare, what new thing proceedeth of the multitude, eſpecially ſince we muſt take heed in iudging not only celeſtial, but alſo eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſes, with the concurrence of things contingent, which alſo both <hi>Ptolemie</hi> meaneth, and chargeth. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> booke 1. chap. 3. vpon the <hi>Quadripartite,</hi> doth plainely confeſſe predictions to be lewd and falſe, and full of vncertaintie, becauſe many ſtars are vnknowne. Farther, the motion or courſe of them that are known, is either vnknown, or vncertaine. And in the natiuitie of <hi>Cl. Lauallus,</hi> Often (ſaith hee) haue I ſaid, that all which is ſaid muſt be vnderſtood, if the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions reſiſt not, as warres, ſhipwracks, plagues, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſedition, lawes. But <hi>Ptolemie</hi> is the beſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of himſelfe. It cannot be (ſaith he) that by art o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8075:80"/> of ſenſible things. Wherfore in handling theſe things we muſt follow only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture, for by inſpiration only do men foretel particulars. Hence it may ſeeme likely, that <hi>Ptolemie</hi> writ the <hi>Quadripartite,</hi> not purpoſely to teach the arte, but to ſhew that there is indeede no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology, &amp; if ther be any, that it is ſuch, as is deſcribed by him, hauing no certaintie, but made to the ſhame &amp; deriſion of Aſtrologers and their arte. In a word the Arabians and Iewes that haue writ of Aſtrologie, doe all agree, as witneſſeth <hi>Aben Ezra cap.</hi> 1. <hi>de natiuitat.</hi> That, whatſoeuer heauen hath decreed, need not come to paſſe, either becauſe the matter is not fit to receiue the influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or becauſe humane affaires depend much vpon our will, or becauſe particular deſtinies, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome of the generall. Or laſtly, becauſe diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence being aboue deſtinie, doth otherwiſe ordaine, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But what do we looke for? When theſe great fenſers haue played their prices, can we not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, except we ſee what <hi>Sauga</hi> and <hi>Cimaleo</hi> will ſay, and the baſe crew of them that can do nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſet

Now that they haue condemned themſelues, doe you looke that they ſhould execute themſelues too? That were too much, &amp; perhaps it is not in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations. To ſhew farther the infirmities, or rather impoſſibilities of their art, we might here ſtand vpon a very great and neceſſarie point, which as yet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues can by no meanes agree vpon, and which of all others ſhould be cheefly agreed vpon, that is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of their twelue houſes. In which it is wonder to ſee how infinitely they vary; ſome vſing the vertical circle; ſome the circle of poſition; others the partes of the equator, and that very diuerſely; ſome alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this man; ſome that; ſome <hi>Ptolemy;</hi> ſome <hi>Aben Ezra;</hi> ſome <hi>Aben Moab;</hi> ſome <hi>Regiomontanus;</hi> ſome <hi>Campaine,</hi> and ſo forth. If any ſhall ſay that this variety is nothing, ſo that we follow ſome one, he is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and ſheweth his ignorance.

But ſaith he in ſuch varietie of opinions, whome we may boldly follow, I cannot tel, only thus much I can ſay, that it is a matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which way we follow this or that. Theſe things being thus, may we not well conclude, with <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> that this art, is nothing but deceitfull conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of ſuperſtitious people, which by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue made an arte of incertainties; whereby to get a few beggerly pence, they might deceiue others, as they are deceiued themſelues.</p>

For when I conſider, and caſt about euerie way, I can hardly find any thing, either ſo loftie, or picked, which may not ſeeme cold, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie and harſh, in ſuch an Auditorie: the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I perceiue diuerſe here preſent, which had been both more fit to vndertake, &amp; more able to performe this office a great deale then my ſelfe. And if I were not for diuers cauſes to frame and temper my ſelfe, partly to the ſtatutes of the Vniuerſity; partly to the cuſtome of our priuate College; and laſtly, to your good pleaſures, I could with all my heart haue wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſome other to haue ſupplied my place at this time, being as it were daunted, partly with your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8075:94"/> and preſence, and partly with the excellency and varietie of the thing in hand. For who either for his owne experience, or eloquence, or full tide of wit, is able to ſet out the praiſe of any one Art what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer? much more of Aſtronomie, the miſtreſſe and monarch of all Arts and ſciences? whoſe memorie is ſo ſetled, ſtayed, and laſting, that it can either inſiſt vpon the particulars, or comprehend the generals? What kind of ſpeech can you deuiſe ſo diuine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, ſo poliſhed with pleaſant numbers, ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſhining words and ſentences, that it may be thought to attaine to the full praiſe of ſo excellent a thing? But in this one thing (me thinks) lyeth no ſmal point of happineſſe, that in this new kind of peroring I haue to do with thoſe men, who being moſt learned themſelues, heare nothing more willingly then the praiſes of learning. And reaſon good: for being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with good Artes, you perceiue what things are good indeed and ſimply: and are able readily to auoid the deceitful &amp; counterfeit ſhew of good. And I hope you will weigh what is fit not for my ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but for your gentleneſſe; for my ignorance, but your skill; for my infancie in peroring, but your elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in all maner of ſpeaking. If I ſhall let ſlip anie thing that might tend to the magnifying of Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, that I hope you of your ſingular curteſie wil ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. If I ſhall in anie point ſeeme to come neere the praiſe of Aſtronomie, then you that haue alwaies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and ſtudied this arte, muſt needes thinke your ſelues not a little aduanced. But if neither I nor anie man els ſhall be able to preuaile with our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if in the mid race we faint and faile; yet euen ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8075:94"/> too ſhall your commendation appeare, as hauing ſpent your time in thoſe ſtudies, which neither tong nor pen can euer ſufficiently extoll. Now this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation I meane to draw to two heads; ſpeaking firſt of her excellency, then of her commoditie. Which two points, if you ſee how great they bee, looke not with what varietie and copie I am like to handle them. For I being manie wayes encombred, muſt doe things as I can, and as the time will permit, not as I would. Now, in the point of Excellency we are firſt to conſider the ſtocke and pedigree of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, who were her Anceſtors and firſt Authours: a verie high point, and wherein all Mathematiques haue much buſied themſelues. They that haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any thing to this purpoſe, are ſo diuerſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſo much, that it were verie tedious to reckon their opinions, there being nothing leſſe agreed vpon not onely among Aſtronomers, but all Mathematicians and learned men.</p>
                  <p>Now firſt and formoſt <hi>M. T. Cicero,</hi> whom a man can neuer praiſe either too often, or too much, fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this noble arte vpon three diuerſe nations, the Aſſyrians, Chaldeans, and Egyptians. For the Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians dwelling in a plaine champion countrey, where heauen lay euery way open to them, did obſerue the courſe and motion of ſtarres, whereby they tooke vp-them to tell mens deſtinies. In which country alſo the Chaldeans, by obſeruation of the ſtarres, are thought to haue made an Art to tell things to come, and caſt mens natiuities. Long after theſe came the Egiptians, who were ſo called not of the arte, but of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Wherefore if we eſteeme &amp; weigh the firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8075:95"/> by time, the Aſſyrians muſt needs be firſt. For the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> (whom for admiration and honour ſake I name perhaps oftner then needes,) affirmeth, that the Babylonians had ſpent 47000. yeares in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing the natiuities of children, let none ſcape at their birth. Which things if they be true, no doubt the antiquitie of this ſcience (to glance at that by the way) muſt needs be ſuch, that all antiquitie can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auouch any thing more ancient. After <hi>Tully</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Seneca,</hi> for vertue &amp; wiſdome inferiour to none; and he maketh <hi>Thales</hi> to haue beene the firſt that gaue light to this Arte, him that was one of the ſeuen wiſe Greekes; who to conuince his aduerſaries, and to proue that euen a Philoſopher could thriue, if he liſt, bought vp all the Oliues in his countrey before they did bloſſome. Of him is alſo reported, that he foretold the Eclipſe of the Sun, which hapned in the raigne of <hi>Aſtyages.</hi> He writ much of the Equinoctial, of <hi>Vrſa maior</hi> and <hi>minor,</hi> much of the greatneſſe of the Sun, of the circles both great and ſmall: laſtly, hee did cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the eclipſes of the Moone for infinit yeares al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. After <hi>Seneca, Plinie</hi> the ſecond, a man verie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for learning, not in the ſtarres only, but all kind of philoſophie: he in his naturall hiſtorie fetcheth this skill from <hi>Beroſus,</hi> to whom the Athenians in their ſchooles erected a publike monument of gold, for his diuination and prophecying.</p>
                  <p>But to prie a litle into Greece the mother and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of all learning and artes, where Philoſophie was bred and borne. <hi>Plato</hi> that worthie Authour and maſter not only of vnderſtanding, but alſo of vttering, who ſpending himſelf in Muſike, Geometrie, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metike,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8075:95"/> and Aſtronomie, flouriſhed a long time at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, hath recorded one <hi>Thoth,</hi> a certaine Egyptian God (whom ſome think was <hi>Mercurie</hi>) to haue taught the Egyptians not only Aſtronomie, but Geometrie alſo &amp; Arithmetike. And theſe be in effect the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Philoſophers which bare any ſway. To inſiſt vpon the toyes of the reſt, were both long, becauſe they be infinite; and tedious, becauſe they are ſcarſe worthie to be reckened for olde wiues tales. Wherefore to come a while to fables, poets, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I meane not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit for lyers, when they faine the heauens and ſtars to reſt vpon <hi>Atlas</hi> ſhoulders: by this not only ſweete, and pleaſing, but alſo admirable deuiſe, what did they mean, but that he, when in long continuance of time he had obſerued the certain courſe of heauen, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly motion of ſtarres, concluded that the heauens and ſtarres had their ſteddy periods and reuolutions, wherein they paſſed their courſe and motions? Now when they faine that <hi>Endymion</hi> was lulled aſleepe of the Moon in mount Latmius, meant they, thinke we to canonize to poſteritie a drouſie pate, as if any were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo impudent, as to ſay it; or mad, as to beleeue it. But their purpoſe was only to point vs out a man, both conuerſant and cunning in the ſtarres, and meaſuring of heauen, who had compaſſed all the varietie of the Moone, both how in coniunction with the Sun, and in other diſtances, ſhe both caſteth vpon the earth that light, which ſhe receiueth of the Sunne, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth great varietie in her light: alſo how in coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with the Sunne ſhe darkeneth his beames and light, and in oppoſitions to the Sun hitting into the ſhadow of the earth, ſhe is ſodainely eclipſed by the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8075:96"/> interpoſition of the earth. But I will not trouble you long with the teſtimonies of Philoſophers and Poets. You haue the opinions of learned men of all ages, which becauſe they are diuerſe, and diſſenting one from another, happen it may that none of them be true, but that mo be true then one, can not happen. But whether they be true or falſe, skilleth not, in this they are all to be commended, that they haue refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the originall of ſo diuine a thing, either to the gods or gods fellowes. But better much, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in our fathers age, did <hi>Philip Melancthon,</hi> and in our memory <hi>Peter Ramus,</hi> whom we all ought to loue for his exceeding ſanctity. Better did <hi>Victor. Strige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who ſetting out bookes in both the Philoſophies, hath benefited not a few, but many, not of his owne nation only, but ſtrangers alſo; not of one onely age, but for many, and almoſt infinit poſterities.

Which they teach not ſuperſtitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or dotingly, but like Philoſophers, with good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of reaſon. <hi>Salomon,</hi> whom we all know to haue excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all that euer were both for learning and wiſdome, as being inſpired rather from God, than taught by man, witneſſeth in plaine words and at large, that hee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:8075:96"/> learned of God whatſoeuer pertained to the framing and motion of the heauens, both for the order of the ſpheres and their motion, in how much time euerie Planet paſſeth the Zodiake, with what varietie of courſe, neuer ſo altering or varying, but that ſtill at the ſame time they returne to the ſame place. Now if diuine <hi>Plato</hi> paſſing all that euer wrote or ſpake, both for varietie and grauitie, when he marked the whole earth firme, and round in the middeſt, and withall the figure of the world to be moſt capable, as able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all other figures, hauing neither rub, nor ſtop, nor angle, nor corner, nor falling, nor ſwelling; when he (I ſay) marked theſe things, if he brake out with this golden ſentence, <hi>Of all Geometricians God is the greateſt,</hi> why may not wee, viewing the wonderfull ſwiftneſſe and conſtant conuerſion of heauen, yearely finiſhing the ſame courſe, with the ſingular preſeruation and maintenance of all things, very truly and well ſay, that there is no Aſtronomer to God. True it is, but it were long to ſhew, with how many reaſons it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that both this arte, and all the reſt are deriued from God himſelfe. For the dignitie of this arte, that alſo maketh not a litle, that being ſo well borne, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly deſcended, when now it was brought from heauen to earth: it crept not into a corner, or ſought to conuerſe with baſe people, but tooke that courſe, whereby ſhee might eaſily keepe her owne, by ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the beams of her fame &amp; renowne far &amp; neere: Wherfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſhe hath made her companions kings and great men, conuerſing euer moſt familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; freely with them, as being ſtirred vp of God, for her protection: wherfore, to ſeek the original, <hi>Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8075:97"/> firſt man, and our firſt father, whom al things did moſt wonderfully and diligently obey, is thought firſt to haue obſerued the courſe of the Sun, and the Moone, and the other ſtarres, with their riſing and ſetting, and ſuch other matters. After him came <hi>Seth,</hi> in yeares I meane after him, but in this skill nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him. Theſe two (as writeth <hi>Ioſephus</hi>) how truelie I cannot tell, when by their diligent peruſing of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they foreſaw the double deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, the one by drowning; the other by burning; erected two pillers; the one of bricke; the other of ſtone; in which both of them graued their inuentions; that if the bricke one ſhould happen to be defaced with the water, the ſtone piller, as ſuruiuer, might remaine to ſhew men what inſcriptions it bare. This ſtone pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in <hi>Ioſephus</hi> his time, was to be ſeen in Syria. The ſame <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> but in another place ſheweth how <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> hauing heard of the great fertilitie of Egypt, went thither, and imparted to them both theſe artes, to wit Arithmetike and Aſtronomie. Againe, when S. <hi>Luke</hi> in thoſe admirable actes of the Apoſtles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo furniſhed with thoſe Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an artes, is he deceiued himſelfe, or would he deceiue others? What ſhuld we ſay of <hi>Romulus,</hi> who is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue built Rome by ſtarcraft, the Moone being in <hi>Libra:</hi> of <hi>Ptolemie,</hi> who for his wit, paines, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was ſo rare and excellent, that he ſeemed to be out of the common reach of men: of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of Spaine, who for his skill, was called by the name of <hi>Aſtrologus?</hi> And to come nearer home, for me thinks our owne and later things are much more pleaſant then thoſe ancient &amp; forren examples, what ſhall we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8075:97"/> ſay of <hi>Ethelſtanus,</hi> who in our chronicles is recorded to haue compiled in this art a fine and learned worke? Of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſeuenth of that name, whether for wiſdome, or wealth more to be admired it is hard to ſay, but how oft by ſome is he reported to haue by the conſtitution of heauen, and ſtarres, to haue dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Chriſtmaſſe keeping? Of his ſonne <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, a ſon worthy ſuch a father, who if he be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with other Kings, not of England onely, but of all Europe, doth ſo far paſſe them all for princely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as the talleſt tree doth the loweſt ſhrub for height? Neither are we here to hearken to <hi>Oſorius,</hi> a man in his own conceit very learned, &amp; in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others not vnlearned: he in the fift booke of the Education, and training of princes, doth in word and ſhew allowe his prince ſome little ſmatch in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomy, but in deed and effect, diſallowed it; For he would not haue his prince to ſpend much time in this ſtudie. For by a certaine abundante caution he is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, leaſt while he maketh too long abode and ſtay in euery of theſe arts, he ſhould too much alienate &amp; ſeuer his ſoul fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, become after a ſort ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and ſo vnfit for gouernment. But <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whom al princes may wel and ſafely follow, and ſo are wont, &amp; ought, was not only skilfull in this ſcience, but had attained not to a ſophiſticall, &amp; prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſhew of artes, but to that perfection, which the Greekes in one word are wont to call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Epicure in deſcribing the nature of God, &amp; <hi>Oſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in his Education ſeeme to haue taken the like courſe. For Epicure, when for his credit ſake; and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſlaunder, he had admitted certaine thorowelight
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8075:98"/> perflable gods, hauing an appearance of a body, with out all ſolide ſubſtance, in the end confeſſeth, that his God hath not a very body, but as it were a bodie, nor any true blood, but as it wer blood. In like ſort, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorius</hi> wil haue his prince but a ſmatterer in al things: not an Aſtronomer, but as it were an Aſtronomer: not a Muſitian, but as it were a Muſitian: not a Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian but as it were a logitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; in a word, not learned, but as it were learned. But to diſmiſſe <hi>Oſorius</hi> with good tearmes, much good do it him with his Kings of his owne breed. In the meane time let vs hold vs to thoſe old ones, <hi>Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, Romulus, Ptolemy, Alpho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſus Ethelſtanus,</hi> &amp; the reſt. Wherfore to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this part of dignitie, me thinke I haue alreadie ſufficiently ſhewed you, not only the countrie of Aſtronomie, but her kind, and nurſerie, and tracts of her aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours. Wherefore it wilbe good to ſtay here, and not proceed farther, that we may come ſooner to the reſt. It is a generall receiued opinion; wherewith all men are poſſeſſed, that Aſtronomie is of great name, great renowne, great ſhew, but of no benefit, no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, as hauing no certaine end, whereat to aime, or whither to refer it ſelfe. To firret this lewd opinion out of the enimies of good arts, to plucke vp by the roote all the ſprigs of this madneſſe, I will declare ſo much as at this preſent commeth to my mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the benefit which iſſueth from Aſtronomie. While I am in this cogitation, ſo many things offer themſelues, ſo weightie, ſo diuerſe, that I feare, how I ſhall weld my ſelfe in the diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>For firſt of all, if we compare the largeneſſe of it, with the ſtraitneſſe of other arts, it may ſeeme either
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8075:98"/> to match all their commendation iointly, or to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoote them wonderfully one by one: for other artes haue euery one their ſeuerall and proper end: Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike to ſpeake perſwadingly; Philoſophie to teach the nature, &amp; cauſes of things; Muſik to teach the skil of ſinging and tuning the curious maner of moodes, how of a ſharp, &amp; a flat handſomly ioined, &amp; couched together, proceedeth ſweet concent, and harmonie. But Aſtronomie entreateth not only of the riſing and ſetting, and motion of the Sun, Moone, and ſtarres, what time they will keepe; but alſo it greatly furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thoſe other a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tes, which vnleſſe they borow light from it, are much obſcured, and darkned. They may be tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ght to remoue the Sun out of heauen, which ſeuer this arte from the multitude. For as the Sun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much bigger then the earth, lendeth light to all other ſtarres: ſo this art repleniſhing all the reſt with the beames of her brightneſſe, doth wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and maintaine their luſtre, and glory. Therefore that of <hi>Plato</hi> is very fit <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, let none come in my ſchoole, that hath not laid a foundation of Geometrie: his meaning (no doubt) was, that they were vnfit for the ſchools of philoſophy which were not firſt furniſhed, not only with geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, but Aſtronomy alſo, and other mathematiques. This rule of <hi>Plato</hi> did <hi>Xenocrates</hi> obſerue all his life long: for when one, who had no mathematiques, wold haue bin his ſcholler, hence (quoth he) thou haſt not the handles of philoſophy. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom we may euermore call the Prince, the Homer, the God of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, all along his writings letteth fall certaine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8075:99"/> mathematicall examples to beautifie and ſet out his writings: wherefore <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> or ſome other, whom I do not well reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber (neither skilleth it much for the name) he, I ſay whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw one that had neuer plaied his prize in the Mathematique ſchooles, daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to get ſomewhat out of him, What (ſaid hee) doth a ſow in a garden? So preciſe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious almoſt were not only Platoniques, but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotelians alſo, to haue their ſchollers to lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of philoſophie in Aſtronomie &amp; other mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathical principles. As for hiſtory our liues miſtreſſe wherein appeareth religion to Godward, pietie to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, loue to euery one, iuſtice to all men. If Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie were not, how drie would it be in reading, how vnpleaſing, &amp; ſenſleſſe. To Aſtronomie doth Hiſtorie owe her two precious eyes, to wit, the deſcription of time, and place. For deſcription of places, to ſpeake of that firſt, without the inſpection and peruſing of heauen, how can that be, or rather what Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie at all, or what geography ſhall we haue without this knowledge, which is at this day ſo ſcarſe &amp; dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that many take the main Ocean to be but a floud, and Ireland to be a citie, and in forren countries, as I haue heard of trauellers, that they think England to be but a towne, &amp; London a great large countrie. A like ignorantly, but more ſpitefully doth <hi>Oſorius</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with M. <hi>Haddon,</hi> that England is nearer Rome then Spaine: who, though he were as mightie as he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, though he ſhould ſpend all his bayſalt vpon the point, yet ſhall he be neuer able either to bring vs nearer to Rome, or ſet Spaine farther off. Whereas
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8075:99"/> therfore he affirmeth Spaine to be much farther from Rome then we are: if he meane that generally of all Spaine, he was neuer ſure any good Coſmographer: but if he meane it of ſome one remote part of Spaine, as Portugall, his Holineſſe doth but gibe &amp; trifle too much. But he will perhaps ſhortly ſet out ſome new maps, we ſhall haue a new England, a new Rome, and a new Spaine, elſe he will neuer be maiſter of that which he ſo ſtriueth for. But my ſpeech is vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon this point, &amp; may ſeem too curious in noting other mens faults: and ſo it might ſeeme iuſtly, if the place it ſelfe did not admoniſh me to ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of this matter. Wherefore to returne whence I haue digreſſed: Geographie, without which there is ſmall vſe of ſtorie, we can no way learne, vnleſſe wee borrow hence certaine neceſſarie doctrines touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the partition of heauen and earth, of their mutual concurrence, of zones, climats, parallels, &amp; ſuch like: but take a way Aſtronomie, and theſe things can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taught nor lerned. The ſame reaſon may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for geography, which ſtaieth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame props. Now he that wil take vpon him to wade through ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries without diſtinction of times, may be likened to him that wold winde himſelf out of a labyrinth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a guide: for if the notation of time be not preſent, like <hi>Ariadne,</hi> and (to vſe the Poets words) guide our darke ſteps, being amazed with the infinit creeks, and windings of ſtories, neither vnderſtand we where we began, or whither we tend, or where to make an end. By the help and hand of this guide, neither do we erre our ſelues, and often times we correct the hiſtorians
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8075:100"/> themſelues. Now if the beſt Aſtronomers haue defined to vs the day, moneth and yeare, if they haue foretold vs long before the manner of intercalating the Epact, golden number, and ſuch like, is it not plaine, how neceſſarie their art is for hiſtorie? What ſhould I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay of Phiſike, how many things be there in this arte, without wh ch he cannot be perfect?</p>
                  <p>Now poetrie being of all others as a moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doctrine, ſo a moſt ſweet medicine: ſhe hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine riſings and ſettings of ſtarres peculiar to her ſelfe, called <hi>Chronici, Coſmici,</hi> and <hi>Heliaci.</hi> Neither poets only diſtinguiſh times by the heauens, but they alſo that haue writ of husbandrie, that there can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Heſiodus, Virgil, Columella, Plinie,</hi> infinite others, if a man be not well entred in this arte. Theſe things, which I poſt ouer now curſorywiſe &amp; briefly, might be handled at large, rhetorically with braue termes, and gallant ſentences: but the longer I haue beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhere, the briefer I muſt be heere. Hence I hope, you ſee how great force, and how many helpes are in Aſtronomy, not only to the adorning, but alſo to the learning of other artes, without which they muſt needs quaile, and goe to ground; if not all, yet the moſt; and if not that, yet ſure the beſt. Neither can I doubt, but that you vnderſtand ſufficiently how raſh or fooliſh, or both, they are, which contemne and deſpiſe Aſtronomy, and al mathematiques, as tending to pleaſure and paſtime, rather then to any vſe, or profit, ſuting wel for quiet, but not for troubleſome times. Of this wiſe opinion was firſt fine <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> that ſmooth skinned minion, whoſevery name is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8075:100"/> and infamous: this man, after he had giuen him ſelfe to be bound hand and foote of filthy pleaſure, by whoſe itch and tickling, his ſenſes yawned, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all geometrie to be falſe. In the like peruerſe and peſtilent manner now a daies doth <hi>Carpentarius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt all mathematiques, that we may well allowe that of <hi>Tully,</hi> affirming that there is nothing ſo abſurde, but it hath come out of ſome philoſophers mouth. <hi>Carpentarius</hi> alleaging in this cauſe nothing that might become either a philoſopher, or a meane wit, is ſufficiently ſchooled of Ramus a great learned man euery way. To ſhew the folly of this opinion, I could produce <hi>Archimedes, Epimachus, Architas, Cteſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and others, which by artificiall engines of their owne deuiſing, ſaued and deliuered their Citties and countries. In defence of this point might be alledged diuerſe examples both moderne &amp; auncient, which at this time I let paſſe: that one notwithſtanding, neither becauſe it is ſhort, would I, nor becauſe it is pleaſant could I, nor becauſe it maketh for the purpoſe, ought I to paſſe. <hi>Pythes</hi> (as relateth <hi>Polienus</hi>) hauing found out gold and ſiluer mines, occupied his whole citie in ſeeking, and digging, and trying gold, leauing off all other workes, as husbandrie, ſowing, ſetting, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, &amp; ſuch like things neceſſary for life, which thing waxing very greeuous &amp; pernicious to his countrie, al the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the towne together came to his wife, deſiring her to deale with her husband, or elſe they were vndone. She putting her goſſips in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, tooke order with a goldſmith, that he ſhould worke her diuerſe diſhes and iunkets very curiouſly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8075:101"/> in gold. <hi>Pythes</hi> comming hungrie home at night cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for his ſupper: his wife ſetteth before him a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den banquet, in which was not one morſel of meate, but all made a good ſhew as if it had bene great dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>Pythes</hi> at firſt commending his wife and the great art of things, deſired her to giue him ſomewhat to eat: whom ſhe ſtil ſerued with the like againe and againe, till <hi>Pythes</hi> being ſharpe ſet, grew into great choller, which his wife cooled with this anſwer: Well then husband, why haue you caſt off husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry to dig gold, which can be nothing worth, except by tillage and husbandrie corne, trees, and cattell, being all moſt neceſſary for the vſe and ſeruice of men, be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and continued? By this pleaſant ſubtiltie of his wife, he perceiuing his folly, let his people returne again to their former trades, which they had lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone. You ſee this ſtorie, which I will not at this time apply, leaſt I ſhould too much diſtruſt your wiſdoms, only this I will note, that we ought not ſo to drowne our ſelues in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation, that we forget action. For as in vertue, ſo in artes the chiefe commendation dependeth of practiſe, therefore that is a worthy ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tully:</hi> The knowledge and contemplation of nature is after a ſort vnperfect &amp; maimed, if it be not accompanied with action, and practiſe. Much is ſaid alreadie, and much more might yet be ſaid. Neither is this knowledge &amp; skill profitable or commodious onely, but alſo very inſtrumentall, and helpfull to our ſaluation, ſince neither nature, nor art hath any thing more potent to ſtir vs to the knowledge of God then the contemplation of heauenly motions. For
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8075:101"/> who in the world is there, whome the order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of ſtarres, whome the heauens in ſo glorious a maner decked, and beautified, whom the comely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of nature would not force to confeſſe, that there muſt needs be a maker, and mediatour of ſo goodly a worke? For firſt the Sun, among the ſtarres King and Keiſar, by turning his courſe Northward, and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, maketh both ſommer &amp; winter, and thoſe other two times, which lie betweene theſe. The yearelie courſe of the Sun doth the Moon after a ſort moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent or imitate, whoſe forme and faſhion doth wonderfully alter, one while waxing, another while waining, hauing in her courſe a certaine reſemblance of the two <hi>Solſtitia.</hi> But moſt admirable are the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the fiue planets, which though they be ſaid to ſtray and wander, yet hold they one and the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant motion for euer: moſt maruellous it is to behold their directions, ſtations, retrogradations, their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, their riſings, how in all eternity they alter not a whit: which when we ſee, if we do not confeſſe that preſent mightie God that made them all, wee are to be counted not only vnlearned, but more bruitiſh then Cannibals. Farther, to ſay ſomwhat of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſſe of this arte, it is ſuch, that if the pleaſures, and delights of all other artes were ſet againſt it, they were nothing. This pleaſure of ſpeculation, which may well be called the foode of the mind, doth ſo far paſſe all bodily pleaſure, which Epicure and ſparrowes ſo purſue, that they are left more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning behind for the pleaſure of the body, which conſiſteth in meat, and drinke, and delightes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8075:102"/> which is both ſmall and vnneceſſarie, and which we may well be without, floweth and paſſeth away, leauing oftner cauſe of repentance, then of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. But this pleaſure of ſtudy and contemplation is both conſtanter and ſurer, not delighting for once, or a while, but often and long: &amp; if that be pleaſing to euery thing, which it doth naturally; as ſwimming to fiſhes; ſinging to thruſhes, it cannot be but men muſt be needs rauiſhed with pleaſure, when they behold heauen ſo great, ſo bright, ſo faire with varietie, ſo firme and conſtant with ſtabilitie. Nature ſheweth, when ſhe had bowed all other creatures down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I know well the qualitie of Aſtrologers. I knowe their kinde, how waiward, how teſtie, how froward they be: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding with their leaue, I wil ſay a word or two, not meaning to moue their choller, but to admoniſh them of their vanitie. If I can gheſſe or diuine any

The like may be ſaid of learning, and other things which are taught: for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomie, did euer man aske a figureflinger, whether the Sun were greater then the earth, or iuſt as bigge as it ſheweth; whether the Moone haue light of her ſelf, or borroweth of the Sun; what motions they both haue; and what the other fiue ſtarres, which are called planets: for theſe queſtions we were wont to go to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtronomers, not to Aſtrologers. Farther, in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to geometrie, can any of them by a figure tel vs how either to double a cube, or ſquare a circle: this skill belongeth to geometrie: laſt of all, can the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger diſcourſe vnto vs of the ſphere &amp; of the Cilinder better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Archimedes;</hi> of ſea tempeſts, better then the Gouernour; of the diſeaſe better then the phiſitian; of the beſt forme of gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expert coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celors or ſtates me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: wherfore if in none of theſe things there be no help of Aſtrology, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee either what it is, or whether it is, or of what things it is, or what vſe it hath. I wil here ſay nothing of natiuities &amp; deſtinies which they are dogge at, neither will I yeeld them ſo much, that they can foretel the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any mans
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8075:103"/> nature, and what he will proue moſt fit for: as for the reſt of their profeſſion I vtterly renounce it. But ſome will ſay, they ſometime tell truth, the euents confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their art: As if any ſhooting all day long, did not ſomtime hit the marke. What is more vncertaine then caſting of dice, yet in long caſting, who doth not ſometimes turne vp that chance which is called <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus,</hi> yea ſometimes twiſe or thriſe, ſhall we therefore like fooles ſay, that it hapned rather by ſome inſtinct of <hi>Venus,</hi> then by chance? I liſt not plead many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, eſpecially amongſt you, which ſee daily how all things fall contrarie to their predictions. But leaſt I ſhuld be too long and tedious, I wil here make an end. Wherefore I pray you, and moſt earneſtly deſire and beſeech you, that if euer you meane to come to any prefection or mediocritie of good arts, you would bend your ſelues to the ſtudy of Aſtronomy, and all true mathematicks, not long ago dead, but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued and raiſed againe. If you reſpect the honour of it, it is diuinely deſcended, of kings and princes euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more vſed. Other arts bragge &amp; boaſt, and thinke wel of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that they are deſcended; namely, milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of <hi>Mars;</hi> Muſike of <hi>Apollo;</hi> Rhethorike of <hi>Mercury.</hi> But let <hi>Mars</hi> giue place to God, and both Militarie, and all other arts to Aſtronomy. Now, if you looke to the profit of it, it is ſuch as none can be greater in this world: for when we ſtudy and meditate on heauen, we rouſe and retch ourſelues we diſpiſe the world, &amp; fixed vpon thoſe celeſtiall ſights, we contemne theſe inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or things as ſimple and nothing worth: the very ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of ſo ample &amp; ſecret things hath a kind of delight
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8075:103"/> moſt commendable, ſtable, firme, and continual, wiſe in the catching, &amp; conſtant in the keeping, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be weakned with ſickneſſe, nor ſtained with ſlaunder, nor waſted with yeares &amp; age. Wherfore go on as you haue begun, and continue that good courſe wherein you are, both to your owne credit, the honor of the Vniuerſitie, &amp; the good both of Gods Church and the common wealth: be moued with the honour, but more moued with the profit: if ſeuerally they can not ſtirre you, yet iointly let them ſtir and reſtir you. For <hi>Ptolemy</hi> turne him and toſſe him night and day, ſtudy him waking, dreame of him ſleeping.</p>
